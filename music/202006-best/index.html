The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.</small></p>
<p>Many of the songs on this list came out in 2019 — this is a little bit of a break from the last few months, but it really does seem to me that the pace of new music coming out is understandably slowing down.  So:  I'm not sorry about it.  I love every single song on this list, and I hope you will to.</p>
<h2 id="thao-the-get-down-stay-down-phenom">Thao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down — Phenom</h2>

<p><em>A Man Alive</em> (2016) by Thao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down is one of my favorite records, so I was ecstatic when I found out Nguyen was releasing a new record.</p>
<p>&quot;Phenom&quot; is a real standout hit, a punchy, dramatic anthem.  It's dissonant and powerful, and when it kicks in, it's an astonishing sound.</p>
<p>Few things could ever replace her sophomore effort in my heart — seriously, please check out &quot;Nobody Dies&quot; — but &quot;Phenom&quot; is equally good.</p>
<h2 id="stef-chura-method-man">Stef Chura — Method Man</h2>
<iframe

<p>My word this album is so good.  This track is so, so good.</p>
<p>It rules.  It rocks and rolls.  I am surely not the first person to compare Chura's work here to Karen O.  This is fine.  Everyone should strive to have a little Karen O about them.  &quot;Method Man&quot; is everything classic-O, and more, from its structure to its crunch.</p>
<p>This album was produced by and sometimes features Will Toledo (Car Seat Headrest), which I feel gives it permission to be crunchy and a little raw around the edges.</p>
<p>Also, that &quot;Eyes Without a Face&quot; cover — wow.</p>
<p>(As a bonus, check out the original version of <a href="https://stefchuraband.bandcamp.com/track/method-man">&quot;method man&quot;</a> from 2010.)</p>
<h2 id="man-man-future-peg">Man Man — Future Peg</h2>

<p>Man Man are back, and they have not let up on their circus soundscape.  Honus Honus really brings his A-game in <em>Dream Huntin in the Valley of the In-Between</em> — so many tracks from this record have gotten stuck in my head for days, but &quot;Future Peg&quot; really takes the cake for me.  There's just so much going on in this track.  It really gets in there and massages every part of your brain.</p>
<h2 id="momma-derby">Momma — Derby</h2>
<iframe

<p>Hey, remember last month when I said this album was going to rule?  Turns out I was right!</p>
<p>Derby is a smashing song; it's cool, it gives me chills.  Etta Friedman and Allegra Weingarten come together in harmony that's indescribable throughout the record, but their double-track melody is astonishing here.</p>
<p>Every time this song comes on, I crank up the volume.  The subtle, glitched-out layering is so beautiful.  And, then, just like that, this 106-second song is over.</p>
<h2 id="disq-loneliness">Disq — Loneliness</h2>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2pMfjOrxan24Yp0gqEYTy4?si=8yBHkYT-R_uWhHld5V8pJQ"
  width="100%"
  height="80"
  frameborder="0"
  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>&quot;Loneliness&quot; is a little bit of a break from the rest of Disq's <em>Collector</em> — it's a longer, slightly more acoustic piece with a catchy but sad melody.  It's touching without being self-pitying.  The chorus, though, is so fantastic in both its lyric content and the music.</p>
<h2 id="emily-yacina-stephanie">Emily Yacina — Stephanie</h2>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5QgCSxUfA2KNdYkOPJ99Us?si=xbHE9HKuQV6AOVqon0bsog"
  width="100%"
  height="80"
  frameborder="0"
  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>&quot;Stephanie&quot; is sweet with a choppy, electronic backbeat.  The ethereal chorus with its choral harmonies give way to a circulating, catchy chorus.  It's almost slightly spooky, or maybe a little chilling.</p>
<p>&quot;Siren Song&quot; is also another hit off of this album; slightly more guitar-oriented, with those same elevated vocals and a delightful horn section.</p>
<h2 id="nation-of-language-indignities">Nation of Language — Indignities</h2>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/02xPs93io1WBzeWZCPZXpC?si=T6dla0qcQta81KbAaZQvwQ"

  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>I wrote about &quot;Rush &amp; Fever&quot; in <a href="../202004-best">April's article</a>, and everything I said about Nation of Language there holds true in their now-released LP, <em>Introduction, Presence</em>.  &quot;Indignities&quot; is groovy, but also New Wave soft.  The projected vocals have an amazing hook.  It's everything great about Cut Copy, if they were also Tears For Fears.</p>
<h2 id="owen-pallett-a-bloody-morning">Owen Pallett — A Bloody Morning</h2>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6auAuEB3bAPi4l8nvVBP57?si=9Kgq-AdZTIqLlZdgqFdAjQ"
  width="100%"
  height="80"
  frameborder="0"
  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>Pallett is back after a six-year break — <em>Island</em> is cinematic, as to be expected, following the traditions the rest of his œuvre has firmly entrenched.</p>
<p>&quot;A Bloody Morning&quot; recalls his previous tracks, but I've always had a real affinity for the class of songs that he's written which have a percussive element to go along with the emotional content.</p>
<p>The orchestral atmosphere here belongs in a movie:  it's sweet, sad, raw, and powerful.</p>
<h2 id="hoops-don-t-panic">Hoops — Don't Panic</h2>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2cOepBHhnpzkubqz0PvRMt?si=uTPCfxvlTVi6G5ny6M-sqQ"
  width="100%"

  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>Hoops doesn't deviate that far from Coldplay in this cover; it's just a little bit crunchier and raw around the edges.  And, it turns out, that just makes the track even better.</p>
<p>Listen:  I actually like Coldplay.  This really is a fantastic track improved upon.</p>
<h2 id="greet-death-strange-days">Greet Death — Strange Days</h2>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/16WMow57UuP7P6T5QD5fmh?si=imiu2TMRQf-rMQnxiBfJ3g"

<p>If the film <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. the World</em> were made today, this song would almost certainly be prominent in one of the sad parts.  The crunchy wall of sound behind Destroyer-like vocals works so well.  The energy is pulled in and out in spectacular ways; halfway through, all we have is just a high hat keeping track of a ringing guitar and the repeating refrain… and then, of course, we kick back in to that wall of sound again.</p>
<h2 id="soul-glo-23">Soul Glo — 23</h2>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4KpqqScwWdnV3N4sVHp637?si=EMJkoZzHRd-16_Bt3gSxIg"

<p>This album is a masterpiece, but it's not for the faint of heart in both its lyric content and musical styling.  &quot;23&quot; is a collection of movements that epitomize hardcore punk in the best ways — it's low-fi, emotional, and a head-banger.</p>
<p>This album touches on the punk DIY scene, race, and relationships.  I'll let &quot;23&quot; speak for itself:</p>
<blockquote><i>
Emotional assimilation is trauma […]<br />
Is trauma's worn, scar-tissued skin<br />
Seared by state-sanctioned aspirations<br />
Underneath my will to live clings tight my will to die<br />
The silent secret of my strength is all the shame I've centralized
</i></blockquote>
<h2 id="happyness-vegetable">Happyness — Vegetable</h2>
<iframe

<p>There's two sides to this driven-but-soft, crunchy-but-acoustic, catchy tune.  It's a relatively conventional indie track, clearly rooted in Elliott Smith's tradition, with an extremely catchy hook and a straight-forward structure; but the way it bends back and forth from driven guitars to an acoustic crawl is really something spectacular.  The instrumentation itself heavily recalls indie rock of years past, but &quot;Vegetable&quot; is still novel.</p>
