<p>Hello!  Here's some more music.  I hope you enjoy it!</p>
<h2 id="kynsy-happiness-isn-t-a-fixed-state">Kynsy — Happiness Isn't a Fixed State</h2>
<p>single, released October 2, 2020</p>
<iframe

<p>&quot;Happiness Isn't a Fixed State&quot; is clearly inspired by The Strokes in every aspect, from the guitar tones, structure of the track, even to Kysny's vocals.  But this is clearly an upgrade, in my mind — her vocal performance, especially, is off-the-charts.  There's so much to love here, like the incredible bass tone, and the rocking guitar lines.</p>
<h2 id="hey-colossus-donkey-jaw">Hey Colossus — Donkey Jaw</h2>
<p>Off <em>Dances / Curses</em>, released November 6, 2020</p>

<p>This song is such a ripper.  Every time it comes on, I end up turning up the volume.  There's a very slightly prog-rock guitar jam going on throughout this entire track, but the thing that really shines the most for me is that astonishing chorus.</p>
<h2 id="why-bonnie-no-caves">Why Bonnie — No Caves</h2>
<p>single, released April 10, 2020</p>

  width="100%"
  height="80"

  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>&quot;No Caves&quot; is a sad song with rocking, slightly-jangly guitars.  Blair Howerton's vocals really shine here, the centerpiece of a clever and sweet song.</p>
<h2 id="biig-piig-feels-right">Biig Piig — Feels Right</h2>
<p>single, released November 17, 2020</p>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0BWBqb5XxraObLopqskk6D"

<p>Any TV show that would use this song as the title track would be the coolest TV show to ever exist.</p>
<p>This song does everything right:  the cool transitions in instrumentation, sometimes even dropping out completely to highlight Jess Smyth's vocals; the super funky bass line; the evolution of the refrain over the course of the track.</p>
<p>Oh, and what a great band name.</p>
<h2 id="wild-nothing-foyer">Wild Nothing — Foyer</h2>
<p>single, released January 1, 2020</p>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5zQJ1SPVOPi0L0z2Av91Wg"
  width="100%"
  height="80"
  frameborder="0"
  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>I feel like I was a little late to the party with this track, but it's good to see that Wild Nothing is still putting out the hits.  &quot;Foyer&quot; is something a bit familiar, with that well-known oceanside, synthy feel, but this track is still unique and will stand out in the catalog as being from this certain era of time.</p>
<p>The chord shifts here are the thing that tends to grab my ear, sometimes shifting slightly outside the key without being too distracting.  There's a lot going on in the room that this track creates, with vocals ping-ponging off the ceiling, which somehow makes even more room for creative decisions in the synth tracks.</p>
<h2 id="jane-weaver-stages-of-phases">Jane Weaver — Stages Of Phases</h2>
<p>Off <em>Flock</em>, released March 5, 2021</p>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3o7SEtJILoqGk8BKRwQxAW"
  width="100%"
  height="80"
  frameborder="0"
  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>This song has an amazing energy and a really delightful fuzziness.  Weaver's vocals are perfect, bouncing on top of a driving, ultra-condensed and distorted rhythm section.</p>
<p>I haven't spent any time with the album that this track supports yet, but I hope to soon!</p>
<h2 id="beautify-junkyards-reverie">Beautify Junkyards — Reverie</h2>
<p>Off <em>Cosmorama</em>, released January 15, 2021</p>
<iframe

<p>&quot;Reverie&quot; is a beautiful, soft composition.  I love the subtle shifts between the percussive elements, and the space that the woodwind-like samples create around the other elements on the track.  There's a skillful reverb embedded in each piece here, and it makes for a really cool effect.</p>
<h2 id="greg-puciato-a-pair-of-questions">Greg Puciato — A Pair of Questions</h2>
<p>Off <em>Child Soldier: Creator of God</em>, released October 9, 2020</p>
<iframe

<p>Man, this song has a great vibe — from those punchy snare punches which bounce across every other instrument, to the chorus which whispers at you while it feels like it's belting.  It's a fun, kind-of eighties feel; with nice beeps and boops and cool transitions.</p>
<h2 id="night-tapes-download-spirit">Night Tapes — Download Spirit</h2>
<p>single, released November 27, 2020</p>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2aTsahtCClICClYsrjYlad"
  width="100%"
  height="80"

  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>&quot;Download Spirit&quot; is a phenomenal EP, with each track clearly standing on its own.  &quot;Truly Being Alive&quot; is a driving electronic thing, and &quot;Fever Dream Kids&quot; is a beautiful serenade.  The track that stands out the most for me, though, is the one which lends its title to the EP.</p>
<p>I really enjoy the almost vaporwave vibes to the instrumentation, and the chorus has a surprisingly catch refrain.</p>
<h2 id="bullion-we-had-a-good-time">Bullion — We Had A Good Time</h2>
<p>single, released February 20, 2020</p>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2rT6h8HuC7FiVZBZjKwkSI"
  width="100%"
  height="80"

  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
<p>I could not tell you why this song tugs at my heartstrings so much.  There's almost a Phil Collins atmosphere in this track, and it accomplishes what I can only guess it's trying to accomplish, which is to make me feel some sort of sadness.</p>
<p>So many things about this song are clever — from the trading percussion of plucked strings and hand claps mixed right into the forefront of the track, to the delightful thunder sound effect followed by the lyric &quot;strikes once.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="men-i-trust-tides">Men I Trust — Tides</h2>
<p>single, released February 12, 2021</p>
<iframe
  src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4M7XuOexX6DotCYbEVsDf9"
  width="100%"
  height="80"

<p>The spacey vibes here make this track a fun slow dance — it's incredibly cinematic.</p>
