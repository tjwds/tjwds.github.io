    <h1>August 2021</h1>
    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>Well, another month in the books!  Here's what I've been up to.</p>
<h2 id="life">Life</h2>
<p>After several starts and stops, I've finally developed an actual workout routine.  <a href="https://fitbod.me/">Fitbod</a> has been a huge help — I'm really not a fan of their price point, but you can't really argue with results!</p>
<p>I am, as always, working on the way that I plan out and reflect on my day.  I've somehow ended up with three journal-like things:  first, my online journal which I write every morning using <a href="https://750words.com">750 words</a> hasn't changed.  I've taken up my daily agenda system again, to mixed results, but I'm no longer doing the repetitive tracking in it that made it onerous — instead of managing my daily habits on pen and paper, I'm still doing that in Habitica, but I've more gone back to using a notebook to plan out and keep track of my schedule for the day.  Finally, inspired by my rereading of <em>The Crow Road</em>, I'm keeping an incredibly short log of what I've done each day in another notebook.  I really like this habit, and I hope I keep it for a while; I think I basically need to be in it for the long haul, since it'll only really pay off when I want to go back and reflect on days in the past.</p>
<p>Finally, I've started playing chess again!  I'm playing on lichess, and I'm doing a little bit of studying with Magnus Trainer.</p>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Here's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  <a href="/music/202108-best">Here's the article</a>, and here's the playlist on Spotify:</p>

<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>Work continues on the microblog platform; I've made some improvements to, well, just about every piece of it now.  I can tell I'm kind of slowing down the pace as I near the &quot;final touches,&quot; but I think if I can just push through one more plateau, I'll now have this great cloud-based platform to start building other services on.  Also, the URL has moved!  You can find those silly posts I'm making here: https://posts.woodssites.com/</p>
<p>I also wrapped up a very quick tool to see which media features your browser reports, which you can find here: https://dev.joewoods.dev/media-features.  I think it still needs some work, but this is the minimum-viable version, and at least it's out there now!</p>
<p>I've just scratched the surface of <em>Programming in Prolog</em> by Clocksin and Mellish.  I haven't quite reached the magic bits yet, but hopefully I'll forge ahead and have more updates when I get there.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Within the first few days of the month, I had already given up on Sandi Tan's <em>Lurkers</em>.  I don't want to give too much of the book away, but it got to the point where I realized that it <em>definitely</em> wasn't for me — the level of psychological violence depicted in the book just wasn't something I was comfortable with.</p>
<p>Next, I read <em>Dark Matter</em> by Blake Crouch.  I really wasn't a fan.  I really liked his later novel, <em>Recursion</em>, but I'm glad I ended up reading them out of order, because <em>Dark Matter</em> has actually somehow impacted my opinion of <em>Recursion</em>.  I didn't think the characters in <em>Dark Matter</em> were believable; the thin wrapper of science fiction was kind of absurd and clearly based on a misunderstanding of the actual concept in physics that Crouch attempted to wrap magic around; the horror sections of the book were at best eye-rollingly frustrating … I could go on and on.  I typically don't expound so much on books I don't like, but I was incredibly disappointed by this one.</p>
<p>So, ending a run of four books that I ended up being disappointed by — my unconditionally positive review was in May! — I read <em>Fool's Errand</em> by Robin Hobb.  I did end up enjoying this one — I think I liked it the least out of the six previous books in the series, but it was still an exciting adventure, even if it wasn't as fun of a romp as the other novels.  There were a few tricks the Hobb had to employ to shake the rust off of a few characters, since they were essentially left aside for a three-book intermission, and I think this made the novel not really come together for me as much as I would have liked.  Nevertheless, this is the first novel in a long time that I found myself setting as much time aside as possible to read.  And now, of course, I have to pace myself, otherwise I'd want to just immediately pick up the next book in the series!</p>
<p>After that, I read <em>The 22 Murders of Madison May</em> by Max Barry.  Barry has always been one of my favorite authors, and I read his novel <em>Providence</em> back in May of this year.  In my view, Barry skirts this line between pulp and too-clever extremely well, making novels that always feel like action films, incredibly well paced with the absolutely cheesiest one-liners thrown in that you can't help but to chuckle at.  But, of course, eventually one of these novels was going to be a bit of a miss for me.  I enjoyed it, but not as much as I typically enjoy Barry's work — this one felt way more like a horror film, and I tend to avoid those.  Also, it's completely unfortunate that this novel was released at a time where we're really facing a flood of the sci-fi motif that this story is built around, and though Barry has done it the best that I've seen so far, I'm just not a huge fan of the trope in general.  I definitely had a good time, but I would recommend that folks new to Barry's work start with another one of his novels instead.</p>
<p>Huh, looks like I read a lot this month!</p>
