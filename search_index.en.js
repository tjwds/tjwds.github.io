listen to music and sometimes make it, poorly.  More often than not, though, I have opinions about it.

The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser.\nI did a very bad job of discovering new music in 2019.  Heck, I did a bad job of listening to music in 2019.  Here's a chart of the total number of songs I've listened to and scrobbled to last.fm, organized by year:\n\nSad, right?  I can do better, and I'm going to this year.  Here are some highlights from January 2020:\nBrand-new music\nClairo — Bags\n\nThis is probably my favorite song to come out of 2019.  The driving backbeat, soothing vocals, and Gotye-esque melodic line just come together so well.  It's strangely emotional, hitting me in the same way that Miya Folick's \"I Got Drunk\" can make me misty before I even realize that feelings are creeping up on me.\nIs it cheating to say that this song is brand new when it's over half a year old?  Probably, but I promise the rest of these lists will tighten up that window.\nLaumé — Voyeurs\n\nLaumé's forrays into disco-inspired electronica in her most recent record, Waterbirth, are unforgettable.  They refuse to get unstuck from my head.  Some other tracks can feel a little off, mostly because of the vocal layering not really coming together for me, but I still highly recommend the record as a whole.  This song will definitely be one that I look back on as a favorite from 2020.\n…And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead —&nbsp;Gravity\n\nTen records!  Holy cow!\nX: The Godless Void and Other Stories feels like we're coming back to Indie Metal from a more experimental detour in IX.  It's a good album, but it just doesn't stand out from the rest of their catalog for me.\nTake, for example, this song, \"Gravity.\" This track seems to call back to \"Isis Unveiled\" twice:  in the group chanting beginning \"The torture of eight days straight…\" and the descending descending vocal growl at \"Oh bloody hell…\"\nOther Trail of Dead fans I talk to seem not to like \"The Century of Self\" as much as I do — see its 6.8 on Pitchfork compared to X's 7.8.  But there's just something about how Century's live-recorded style packs a huge punch that I haven't heard from any other album ever, be it by AYWKUBTTOD or anyone else.\nSea Girls —&nbsp;Ready For More\n\nIt's a pop song.  It's got strings in the background, if you listen close.  It will be on the radio.  It's pretty good.\nHoly Fuck —&nbsp;Moment\n\nThis song would be in a movie if some executive wouldn't say \"Come on, we can't put that band's name in the credits.\"  In reality, it should be at least forever immortalized as the title track to a very good T.V. show.\nIt almost half the song for the vocals to come in, but the buildup is worth it.  This track sits on such a fun edge of danceability — if I heard this playing in a public place, I'd be ready to groove but also sort of frightened.\nDiscoveries\nAlvvays —&nbsp;In Undertow\n\nAlvvays, as always, knocked it out of the park with this song 2017.  I heard it on this record when it had come out originally, but didn't really appreciate it then.  The ripping, layered guitar lines come together to build to an engaging final refrain and wrap up so sweetly.\nUnderworld —&nbsp;I Exhale\n\nEight minutes!\nThis song gives me the same feelings that LCD Soundsystem's more emotional tracks do.  Though I don't find the lyrics as touching, the mechanical rhythm and repeating chords don't go stale, but get somehow sadder as the song proceeds.  The hidden digital distortion combined with falsetto howling don't sound as bad as the combination of the words \"digital distortion combined with falsetto howling\" would lead you to believe —&nbsp;it all comes together for a powerful package that you can put on in the background while, I don't know, washing the dishes and thinking about your life.  You know, as one does while listening to LCD Soundsystem.\nEternal Summers —&nbsp;You Kill\n\nSick riffs and Nicole Yun's powerful vocal performance make this poppy track inspirational.  I should spend more time with this group's catalog —&nbsp;based on this one track, I'm sure there's many more hits in there.\nAs I write this, this track has around 200,000 plays on Spotify, which seems like an actual crime.  Eternal Summers should be playing this song in a stadium, where the guitar will kick in and roll out to the lawn seats like a scene from Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.\nSiouxsie and the Banshees — Into The Light\n\nHow had I never listened to Siouxsie and the Banshees?  What instrument even is that in the verse?  How did this sound even exist in 1981?\nNAVVI — From The End And Start\n\nA music critic referred to NAVVI as synth-pop, which I don't think quite fits.  They're like…&nbsp;dark electronica with indie roots.  They're like if The XX had a goth phase.  They're so good, especially this track.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202001-best/","title":"New Music:  January 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/20200203-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nOkay.  You'll notice that this article covers two months worth of music.  I'm sorry!  We're all doing our best right now, myself included.  But here's some cool music that just came out that I've been listening to while working from home.\nGeorgia —&nbsp;Never Let You Go\n\nDang, it was hard to just pick one song from this record.  Never Let You Go is probably one of the poppier pieces from the rest of the lofi hip hop-inspired, danceable tracks.  I want to take a road trip to this song — this is a track for doing things to.  Maybe mostly dancing.  I mean this as a complement:  any one of the tracks on this album would be in Skins if it were made today.\nThe record's title, Seeking Thrills, is a bit of a misnomer, because you don't have to look very hard to find thrills in this record.  Please listen to it cover-to-cover.  Or at least listen to \"Mellow,\" on the more hip hop side of the spectrum of this record, where Shygirl's feature pushes the track to be a hit.\nAutomatic —&nbsp;Signal\n\nDang this is a jam.  This is, like, my exact taste in music.  Lofi; drum, bass, and a little synth; with post-new-wave vocals provided by Izzy Glaudini et. co.  It's sort of horror rock.  Okay, no, here's the best explanation for anything I'm ever going to give, so buckle up:  Brian David Gilbert, in a now-deleted tweet, described a genre:  \"MUSIC FOR BEING CHASED WITHIN A CASTLE.\"  That is this.  This is it.\nI don't want to compare Automatic to La Femme, because I feel like that's not quite fair.  They're similar in instrumentation, but maybe the goals are slightly different.  Maybe the closest relative to what Signal (the record, not the track) accomplishes is Gymnastics by Sneaks.  It pushes the limits of how bass and drums can create a groove and not be New Wave.  Somehow, this is exactly what I always want to hear.\nCorridor —&nbsp;Domino\n\nDomino, like the rest of its record Junior, has an energetic surfer-rock vibe where the guitar line is louder than the French-language, rolling paroles.  The backbeat doesn't really change over the course of the song, even when everything drops out to just bass and drums to build back up.  Every part involved in this track contributes to the voltage that's generated by the tight instrumentation that comes together without forcing the issue.  It's almost like the vocal line combines with the rhythm section to croon, but it still, to me, feels as energetic as, say, the shouting dance style of Death From Above 1979.\nThe whole record's like this —&nbsp;listen to \"Pow\" next.\nCar Seat Headrest —&nbsp;Can't Cool Me Down\n\nYou know how Bob Dylan plays a synth now?\nCar Seat Headrest rules.  Will Toledo is probably incapable of not writing a hit every time he sits down at the keys now, just like how he wrote a hit every time he took a guitar into his car.  If you had told me that the first thing that would come to mind from Toledo's next hit would have been \"groovy,\" I'm not sure I would have believed you, but here we are:  it's a really groovy, smooth, surprisingly electronic Car Seat Headrest song, and it rules.\n\"Can't Cool Me Down\" is clearly the next step in the CSH evolution.  It's soulful and cool and an indicator of even more greatness to come soon.\nÁsgeir —&nbsp;Turn Gold To Sand\n\n\"Turn Gold To Sand\" is one of songs on Sátt that departs more from folk and ends up closer to an electronic in the style of James Blake.  It's good, and it provides a texture to the rest of the record that keeps it engaging as you listen to it cover to cover.\nBut an obviously huge part of the project is the environmentalist message, which I wholeheartedly welcome. Can you divorce art from the political?  No. Is global warming a hoax?  Also no.  So please forgive me as I briefly touch on this:\nYou could go ahead and say that other people are doing things to destroy the future of the natural world around us that are much worse than the things that you do in the everyday decisions that you make, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't all do a little bit better.  Please do that one thing that you're thinking about that would shrink the scar that you'll leave behind on this planet.\nAnyway.  Great song!  Great record.  There's also an Icelandic-language version of the album, Sátt.  Speaking of Iceland…\nDaði Freyr — Think About Things\n\nYes, this is a song from Eurovision 2020.  It's so good.  Just watch the music video:\n\n\nFreyr's family and friends got together to make a funky pop hit that will be stuck in my head for the rest of time.  It's almost impossible not to dance along to this song —&nbsp;unless you're otherwise captivated by the music video or the live performance that won Daði &amp; Gagnamagnið the right to represent Iceland in the now-cancelled Eurovision 2020.\n\"Think About Things\" is undeniably in the vein of traditional pop music, but it also somehow manages to sound like the kind of thing that should come out of the instruments that Gagnamagnið's backing dancers play.  The amazing vocal harmonies come together so well in the chorus.  The song is cinematic and catchy, and it's going to borrow time inside your head to play itself over and over, if it hasn't already.\nLa Roux —&nbsp;Automatic Driver\n\nThough few tracks could ever be as catchy as \"Bulletproof,\" \"Automatic Driver\" comes awfully close.  Like the rest of her discography, the track is not simple, but it is straight-forward:  which, honestly, is refreshing and often what a hit needs.  The refrain \"I wanted to manage information / Find the automatic driver\" is just as unfamiliar but ear-worming as \"This time maybe I'll be / Bulletproof.\"\nBut even if this song wasn't in conversation with the weight of La Roux's breakout hit, it still would end up finding a place in my heart.\nThe Wants —&nbsp;Fear My Society and The Motor\n\nNo idea what's going on here.\n\nI really couldn't pick just one. Container is almost certainly going to be my favorite record of this year, and it would take a lot of work for it to not end up in the top three of this decade for me.\nSo… you know how Muse started off as this band that made Hyper Music (as a style, not the song) and then made a bunch of other albums?  If you like Muse's relatively early records and you want to know what it would have been like if they'd come from New York from roughly right now, Container is probably as close as it gets.\n\"Fear My Society\" is such a powerful question of a song. Madison Velding-VanDam is so good:  there's so much powerful acting in the way that he sings each.  Heather Elle's vocals just punch the whole track into motion.  The mathematical precision of the three-piece work of a complicated but not overbearing layered guitar and bass are the epitome of rock.\nNext on the tracklist is \"The Motor,\" an energetic, slightly cacophonous jam with a radical bassline and a guitar riff that just absolutely rips. It's sparsely lyric'd, which is perfect.  Based on an earlier live recording, the vocal line was a relatively recent addition to the song, and I'm really glad they took the time to get it right.  It's not a particularly fast song (130-ish beats per minute) but boy is it fast and intense.  This would make an amazing song to run to, just like the rest of the record.\nShopping —&nbsp;Initiative\n\nQueer indie-punk Shopping are not the B-52s.  They are, to me, what would happen if you listened to the B-52s and thought, \"hey, what if this, but even better?\"\n\n\nEach track is simultaneously minimal but still somehow atmospheric.  It's hard to believe that this sound comes from a three-piece; the way that the bass and leads play off each other to make groovy anthems is seriously impressive.\nIn the delightful music video, Andrew Milk wears a post-it note which admonishes \"DO BETTER\" —&nbsp;I don't think that should even be in the cards.  Nothing about this album could be better because it is the best.\nCable Ties —&nbsp;Lani\n\nLani is seven and a half minutes of crunchy bass with Jenny McKenchie's open but soft, almost operatic lyrics on top.  The song is filled with noise, but gives itself space to really jam and iterate on itself.  Cable Ties are often described as punk, but that doesn't really fit for this track, for me; it's a garage symphony.\nHave A Nice Life — Dracula Bells\n\nI heard this song in a combination record store / board game shop.  It sounds exactly like what music playing in a very cool record store slash board game shop should sound like.\n\"Dracula Bells\" comes out kicking and then sustains a frisson-inspiring energy over the next seven-and-three-quarters minutes.  The tone of the base which drives the narrative coming out of the first chorus.  The intense, spooky reverb on the vocals culminate in a dark shift which you'll know when you hear it.  \"Dracula Bells\" is a rockin' centerpiece for Sea of Worry's well-rounded mission, which also rocks.  Don't forget to check out \"Trespassers W,\" which is more of a conventional punk-ish indie cut that reminds me of Japandroids.  The album is well rounded, but necessarily goth — \"Destinos\" seems like a necessary addition to make sure you know what type of music you're listening to, though I'm not quite sure if it's for me.  The rest of the album, though?  So good.\nSorry — Right Round The Clock\n\n(Explicit content)\nI've been a bit obsessed with this record.  It's honestly a little obscene and makes me a little uncomfortable, but I can't stop listening to it.  For this track, in particular, the way the horns in the chorus punctuate the very cool indie vibes that are very clearly trying to draw you in in a certain way.  It's almost a little…&nbsp;Moulin Rouge?  That's a bad comparison.  You'll get it when you hear it.\n925 is impossible to pick one song off of, for good reason.  Sorry has done the right thing in that they've been releasing the singles that ended up comprising this record since 2018 (!!) and just picked the best ones to put on here.  \"Starstruck\"… such a good song.  \"Snakes\" is weird and uncomfortable and it's just so great.  Some of their songs take up the great English tradition of the Arctic Monkeys songs that tell stories (\"Heather\", \"Rosie\").\nThe electronic influences their symphony of guitars come together so well. Sorry is The XX if Karen O was the frontwoman.  I don't even know who you are if that doesn't sound amazing to you.\nSoccer Mommy —&nbsp;bloodstream\n\n(Explicit content)\nThis track really stood out to me from the rest of the record.  Something about it is frisson-worthy from the very outset; the four chords take their own time to deliver something sort of sombre and contemplative.  Allison's shoegaze-style vocals drive home a point over a more clear instrumentation that works to build upon itself.\nI honestly don't understand this track.  It's sad and it's good.\nPorridge Radio — Sweet\n\nThis is such a weird, creepy song, and I love it.\nplink … plonk …&nbsp;plink …&nbsp;plonk\nLike, what even are these lyrics?  How does this wall of noise work?  Why do I love this song so much?\nplink … plonk …&nbsp;plink …&nbsp;plonk\n\"You will like me when you meet me / you might even fall in love\" Bluuuuuuggghhhhhuhhh.  So creepy.  Buuh.\nplink … plonk …&nbsp;plink …&nbsp;plonk\nThe Innocence Mission —&nbsp;Stars That Fall Away From Us\n\nThis track is like Nick Drake meets Beirut.  The ethereal vocals do not convey vowel shapes that you would expect to come out of Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  But this song in particular is a gorgeous soundscape that doesn't try too hard to drive a point home; the chorus is punctuated by a delightful rhythm section that still lets the rest of the song do the talking.\nI get the same feeling from this track that I do from Beirut's The Flying Club Cup, in that it feels like it's truly about something, even if you're not trying to hard to understand the vocals.  It feels like a soundtrack to an interesting life, albeit maybe a sort of sad one.\nActivity — Earth Angel\n\n(Explicit content)\n\"Earth Angel\" starts off smooth and sulky, Travis Johnson's gently eeked out stylings quietly croon with the rest of the instrumentation, vocal artifacts perfectly matching the digital glitch in the drum section.\nAnd then the rush comes in.  I don't even want to spoil it by describing it.\nGrouplove —&nbsp;Youth\n\nGrouplove's Healer is another set of energetic tracks, continuing the now almost decade-long tradition of Grouplove releasing a collection of danceable tunes that sort of shout at you a little bit. \"Youth\" is a bit of a departure from the rest of Grouplove's tracklist.  It's groovy, cyclical, cool — not to say that the rest of Grouplove's tracks aren't, but it seems like the project here is slightly different.  But there's still that same vibe here; if you like the relentless positivity of Grouplove and want to hear it in a more rolling, less staccato style —&nbsp;which you should — check this song and the rest of the record out.\nRadiator Hospital —&nbsp;My New Chord\n\nRadiator Hospital has done it again&nbsp;—&nbsp;\"My New Chord\" is probably one of the more gripping songs that I've ever heard.  It packs so much in its sub-two-minute punch; the catchy vocal line which lays overtop of its bass guitar twin is genuinely emotive.  In the same vein of the original \"Mad World,\" the driving backbeat and major key groupings delightfully disguise poetry:\n\n Days drag on until they're done\n Hours blur into each other\n Just one look and then I'm gone\n I can't bear to take another\n\nListen:  Sings 'For Music Daydreaming' has gotten a bad rap online.  I'm honestly astonished folks don't seem to be as taken in by it as I am.  Every song tells a story, and though the stories are mostly dark, it comes together as a whole that should be considered one of the greatest.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/20200203-best/","title":"New Music:  February and March 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202004-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nWhat a month, huh?  Somehow, despite it all, it really does feel like some absolutely fantastic albums and tracks have come out recently.  Here are a few that stuck out for me.\nMoaning —&nbsp;Ego\n\nI stumbled upon Moaning's sophomore effort completely on accident after coming across \"Don't Go\" on my Spotify \"Your Top Songs 2018\" playlist and I'm very glad that I did.  Uneasy Laughter is a masterpiece of a record.  It's dark and mysterious; it's quintessentially shoegaze, but there's so much range between each track on the record that I will never get tired of listening to it.\nIn \"Ego,\" the rising tones of the refrain \"I want to be anybody but myself / I want to love anybody but myself\" legitimately give me chills.  It's like all of the feelings evoked by the new wave hits of yesteryear in one beautiful package for the year 2020.  It's a powerful call to action, and it's hard not to get wrapped up in it.\nElsewhere on the record, \"Stranger\" is a devastating ballad with a dark, gorgeous, reverbed vibe.  \"Make It Stop\" is exactly what it sounds like — a haunting refrain with a real mission, where guitars that would be absolutely screaming if they weren't slightly buried and a punchy, octave-driving bass circle around to an emphatic chorus.\nUneasy Laughter should stand up as era-defining.  It should be the album that we point to as one of the masterpieces of this decade.\nBAMBARA — Stay Cruel\n\n(Explicit content)\n\"Stay Cruel\" is a dark, brooding song.  It sounds cinematic; it tells a sinister story alongside an almost country-western symphony smothered and covered by a passionate vocal style and harsh lyrics.  There's something evil about it; a leather-jacket-wearing, slowly simmering cool.\nMidwife — S.W.I.M.\n\nMidwife did a great job with this track which they left for last on Forever.  The deep reverb on every single layer on the song —&nbsp;even the drums — devours the very distorted, unapologetic vocal line.  And somehow there's space amongst all the noise for a sweet, sad guitar melody to add to the layers.\nAnother fantastic track off Forever is \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" — no relation — which also tells an equally sad tale with its instrumentation and vocal melodies.\nNation of Language —&nbsp;Rush &amp; Fever\n\n\"Rush &amp; Fever\" is extremely cool; it beeps and boops but remains laid back.  They do a great job of replicating the gut-wrenching crooning of The National's Matt Berninger —&nbsp;the \"save, us save us, saints from above\" from the chorus sounds like it would fit right in on High Violet — on top of a sort of Tears For Fears vibe.  It works really well, coming together in a bouncy, hip, danceable jam.  There's a little bit of pastiche in this track.  But still, it's really good.\nLanterns on the Lake — Baddies\n\n\"Baddies\" starts as a stripped-down tune and evolves into a beautiful ballad with gorgeous harmonies and epic, jarring chords.  The balance between its verses and the powerful chorus is startling; it shifts between soft and loud without trying too hard.  It's a jam which knows when to drop down to be quiet.  If you looked at the waveform of this track, it would be a shifting figure that may actually be completely silent at some points and 100% signal at others.  It's a very sly, cool track with very catchy vocals.\nDamien Juardo — Alice Hyatt\n\nThe underwater vibe here combines so well with vocals that almost sound like James Blake with Ween-style vocal effects.  The record that this single supports just came out on May 1st; if it's anything like this track, I'm sure it'll be one to cherish for a while.\nAgnes Obel — Broken Sleep\n\nWhat a beautiful song.  I have no idea what's going on here with the sampled, chopped up melodies which sit on top of very light percussive not quite piano notes — Obel's dulcet vocal line is modified, extended by clearly digital effects in a way that catches your ear.  As the song builds on itself, the strings sound almost like a ticking clock, creating a deep atmosphere that's easy to get hooked on.\nWilsen — Feeling Fancy\n\nTasmin Wilson's vocals here are so pure and gorgeous.  They play so well overtop of a sweet, atmospheric backbeat which often trades where it places its emphasis; it's not quite math rock, but it's an indie that gives itself space to experiment while still sounding very put-together and extremely well produced.  The combination of Wilson's double-tracked vocal timbre and the spacey, nearly-constant guitar emphasis work so well together — but at other times, it's just Wilson singing on top of a lullaby-like arpeggiation that may or may not be guitar with other stuff sprinkled in.  It's so hard to describe this track, but it is obviously and clearly beautiful.\nWaxahatchee —&nbsp;Witches\n\n\"Witches\" is a nice semi-country jaunt which tells a story whose lyrics rarely actually register with me as I listen to it, but sounds so utterly sweet and sad.  The clean rip of the short guitar solo which brings in a verse just fits so perfectly with the drawl and harmonies which so clearly evoke indie rock from the American South.  Katie Crutchfield does a great job here picking up the torch for a great literary tradition formed by country music tropes; \"Witches\" rules and you should give it a shot, even if you \"don't like country.\"\nKiwi jr. — Wicked Witches\n\n\"Wicked Witches\" sounds a whole lot different than the rest of Football Money, Kiwi jr.'s debut record.  It claps and wiggles, and it's a fun party in a way that's slightly different from the rad party of the rest of the album.  Kiwi jr. is following the path that Stephen Malkmus has set up for them; the record has a pretty 90s/early-2000s indie rock vibe, and it comes together so well.  This track itself, though, is delightfully choppy and eager and just a good time.\nLewsberg — Cold Light of Day\n\nIt was impossible to pick one song off this record.  Do you like Television?  Do you like Ought?  If so, you should sit down, play this record, close your eyes, and let it wash over you.\n\"Cold Light of Day\" is probably one of the more approachable tracks off the album, with a heavy groove and killer guitar riffs.  The sing-talking lyrics come in with a kick — this track is just an absolute jam that can rivaled the greatest Jam Bands.\nWho you are and who you think you are\nThings you take, things you take too far\nThings you expect to happen…\nUp and away in the cold light of day, up and away.\nI have another favorite in \"Left Turn,\" which kicks the album off with a dissonant, repeating chord that reflects the ripping poetry inside.  These two songs together set the stage for the rest of the work, which is so incredible.  I wasn't kidding; please just close your eyes and listen.\nDeeper —&nbsp;Lake Song\n\nDeeper's Auto-Pain is an incredibly cool album, cover to cover.  There's a driving pace behind \"Willing,\" with a semi-funk bassline and choppy, clean guitars that are so perfectly blended with the emphatic sung melody.  But the haunting synth and percussive guitar solo in \"Lake Song\" drives the rest of the pendulum-like groove, creating a rich atmosphere with plenty of space and passion.\nTorche — Admission\n\nOoh, that crunchy bass line.  Torche could probably be considered a metal band, but this song defies genre in such a fantastic way.  The powerful bass and reverby, constant guitar licks combine with a very clean, tactile drum beat and some surprisingly \"alt\" vocals to make a heart-wrenching package.\nThere's a really quick shredding guitar solo a little over two minutes into the song that goes a long way to contribute to the wall of thunder conveyed by this track.  Some folks might be put off by the vocal style, but please don't be:  embrace the rock.\nMush —&nbsp;Revising My Fee\n\nMush's lead singer, Dan Hyndman, has turned his throat into a column; a muted French horn through which he blasts, well, a handful of complaints.\n3D Routine is the early work of The Arctic Monkeys if it was more punk and actually had class consciousness.  Each individual song off of this record is a ripper — a peppy, crunchy jam to take collective action to.\nAlso, they sound really good on recordings.  This video basically sounds exactly like the album version, but with enough room to improvise in the guitar solo to still feel like a song that they enjoy shredding.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202004-best/","title":"New Music:  April 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202005-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nIt feels really trite right now to be writing about my own personal experience with music when the United States is calling for justice and the halt of racist violence against its citizens.  But I find joy in the work created by these artists, so I want to share that joy with you all, too.\nLocate S,1 — Personalia\n\nYou know how Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer? is a record that is perfect in any way?  If you're a fan of that era of Of Montreal, you'll love \"Personalia\" —&nbsp;the track and the record.\nThe bassline here just pops.  It's so powerful, and it's a perfect counterbalance to the \"Mad World\" (Tears for Fears) atmosphere.  This song is sweet and sad, it's upbeat and bouncy.  It is, of course, reminiscent of the heavy themes and danceable beats from Hissing Fauna.\nI want to belt this song in a karaoke room.  I want to dance wildly to this song at an Of Montreal-style show while singing along.  Easily one of the best songs of the year for me.\nMint Julep —&nbsp;Unite\n\nIt was hard for me to pick just one song off of this record.  This song glides and dips like a peaceful airplane: the overdriven pads start the ethereal vibe, building to the delay-heavy verse.  But all of this is the perfect counter to the atmospheric, sprawling, symphonic chorus.  After the chorus, the reverb on the vocals hangs in the air, only to be cut short by a delightful digital tom-tom.\nIt's hard for me to understand the vocals in this song.  Vocals are something that I place a lot of value in, but I don't think that matters so much here.  The vocal melody, here, is another track creating a counterbalance to the layered melodies which ping, crunch, and strum throughout the rest of the song's journey.\nAnna Burch — Not So Bad\n\nBurch's If You're Dreaming is an excellent followup to her first record, Quit the Curse, but \"Not So Bad\" is a standout to me for its evocative lyrics and catchy melody.  \"Not So Bad\" is a rising, jangly refrain that delightfully reflects its title.  The lyrics are a wonderful, semi-obscured reflection on a relationship, perfectly paired to its instrumentation.\nSquirrel Flower — Red Shoulder\n\nWow.  This tune is cinematic, with deep, country-western vibes and resonating guitars.  The transitions between vocal and non-vocal sections perfectly amp up the energy and heart-wrenching emotions.  This is one of the more driven tracks off the record, which tend toward a little folk, but this track isn't out of place for the thunderous power it brings:  Ella O'Connor Williams brings her A-game to each track with her resonant, engaging voice.  Expect each track to be as sweet and sad as this one.\nPerfume Genius —&nbsp;Describe\n\nSet My Heart On Fire Immediately is another great collection from Perfume Genius.  I almost have a hard time listening to this song because it is so sad.  The slide guitar and mandolin are a slight departure from the Perfume Genius songs I'd heard before, but the sparse lyrics and dense soundscape pull together to tell a story that I cannot put a name on or really tell why it brings so much emotion.  Then, suddenly, the song cuts to a slow, far-away organ hum.\nRingo Deathstarr —&nbsp;Just Like You\n\nRingo Deathstarr are back, taking a page out of the Slowdive handbook by releasing a shoegaze masterpiece after an already storied career.\n\"Just Like You\" is a ripper.  With \"Only Shallow\"-style, circling instrumentation, it punches forward with every note.  It is a soft headbanger.  It belongs in a movie.\nMomma —&nbsp;Double Dare\n\nThe harmonies of Friedman and Weingarten's vocals here are astonishing.  It's hard to tell where their melodies end and begin with respect to each other and the rest of the song; creating astonishing, gripping effects that are hard to describe.\nThis rolling track has a sly narrative inside, smart in the same way that the composition is smart.  It's so good.\nThis is one of a handful of recent singles to be released by Momma, all of which are absolute jams.  I'm really looking forward to the record they support, due on June 5th.\nWednesday —&nbsp;Maura\n\nWell, from the way the song starts you just know that something's coming.\nThe rising and falling nature of this track is so cool.  Taken together as one whole, this song is powerful and energetic.  It's a beautiful, not-quite punk; the screaming guitar over the chorus vocal melodies which continue through to a refrain and then suddenly drop out to Hartzman, alone — so good.\nI also highly recommend \"Fate Is…\" from \"I Was Trying to Describe You To Someone\" — a shorter but powerful jam.\nPintandwefall —&nbsp;People Like Me\n\nThis slow, garage-y tune is a perfect series of vocals, bass, guitar, drums, and synth combined.  There's a slight syncopation in the chorus which is very very catchy; you can hear all aspects of the instrumentation in the room, and it's delightful.\nKatie Von Schleicher — Wheel\n\nThis short track epitomizes the fantastic sound of Katie Von Shleicher's latest record, Consummation.\nThere's an extremely crunchy guitar which surprisingly does not sound out of place on top of the deep, resonant vocals.  The way it kicks in in the chorus with a series of punches that fade back and forth is fantastic.\nGengahr —&nbsp;Heavenly Maybe\n\nThe round bass line drives this song.  It barely changes as the song proceeds, while the rest of the instrumentation evolves, filling out, adding and removing layers that catch your ear and nod your head.\nThe very subtle layering on the vocals really make the track, with falsetto support whispering overtop of a delightful timbre.\nIn short:  this track is a jam!\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202005-best/","title":"New Music:  May 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202006-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nMany of the songs on this list came out in 2019 — this is a little bit of a break from the last few months, but it really does seem to me that the pace of new music coming out is understandably slowing down.  So:  I'm not sorry about it.  I love every single song on this list, and I hope you will to.\nThao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down — Phenom\n\nA Man Alive (2016) by Thao &amp; The Get Down Stay Down is one of my favorite records, so I was ecstatic when I found out Nguyen was releasing a new record.\n\"Phenom\" is a real standout hit, a punchy, dramatic anthem.  It's dissonant and powerful, and when it kicks in, it's an astonishing sound.\nFew things could ever replace her sophomore effort in my heart — seriously, please check out \"Nobody Dies\" — but \"Phenom\" is equally good.\nStef Chura — Method Man\n\nMy word this album is so good.  This track is so, so good.\nIt rules.  It rocks and rolls.  I am surely not the first person to compare Chura's work here to Karen O.  This is fine.  Everyone should strive to have a little Karen O about them.  \"Method Man\" is everything classic-O, and more, from its structure to its crunch.\nThis album was produced by and sometimes features Will Toledo (Car Seat Headrest), which I feel gives it permission to be crunchy and a little raw around the edges.\nAlso, that \"Eyes Without a Face\" cover — wow.\n(As a bonus, check out the original version of \"method man\" from 2010.)\nMan Man — Future Peg\n\nMan Man are back, and they have not let up on their circus soundscape.  Honus Honus really brings his A-game in Dream Huntin in the Valley of the In-Between — so many tracks from this record have gotten stuck in my head for days, but \"Future Peg\" really takes the cake for me.  There's just so much going on in this track.  It really gets in there and massages every part of your brain.\nMomma —&nbsp;Derby\n\nHey, remember last month when I said this album was going to rule?  Turns out I was right!\nDerby is a smashing song; it's cool, it gives me chills.  Etta Friedman and Allegra Weingarten come together in harmony that's indescribable throughout the record, but their double-track melody is astonishing here.\nEvery time this song comes on, I crank up the volume.  The subtle, glitched-out layering is so beautiful.  And, then, just like that, this 106-second song is over.\nDisq —&nbsp;Loneliness\n\n\"Loneliness\" is a little bit of a break from the rest of Disq's Collector — it's a longer, slightly more acoustic piece with a catchy but sad melody.  It's touching without being self-pitying.  The chorus, though, is so fantastic in both its lyric content and the music.\nEmily Yacina —&nbsp;Stephanie\n\n\"Stephanie\" is sweet with a choppy, electronic backbeat.  The ethereal chorus with its choral harmonies give way to a circulating, catchy chorus.  It's almost slightly spooky, or maybe a little chilling.\n\"Siren Song\" is also another hit off of this album; slightly more guitar-oriented, with those same elevated vocals and a delightful horn section.\nNation of Language — Indignities\n\nI wrote about \"Rush &amp; Fever\" in April's article, and everything I said about Nation of Language there holds true in their now-released LP, Introduction, Presence.  \"Indignities\" is groovy, but also New Wave soft.  The projected vocals have an amazing hook.  It's everything great about Cut Copy, if they were also Tears For Fears.\nOwen Pallett —&nbsp;A Bloody Morning\n\nPallett is back after a six-year break — Island is cinematic, as to be expected, following the traditions the rest of his œuvre has firmly entrenched.\n\"A Bloody Morning\" recalls his previous tracks, but I've always had a real affinity for the class of songs that he's written which have a percussive element to go along with the emotional content.\nThe orchestral atmosphere here belongs in a movie:  it's sweet, sad, raw, and powerful.\nHoops — Don't Panic\n\nHoops doesn't deviate that far from Coldplay in this cover; it's just a little bit crunchier and raw around the edges.  And, it turns out, that just makes the track even better.\nListen:  I actually like Coldplay.  This really is a fantastic track improved upon.\nGreet Death —&nbsp;Strange Days\n\nIf the film Scott Pilgrim vs. the World were made today, this song would almost certainly be prominent in one of the sad parts.  The crunchy wall of sound behind Destroyer-like vocals works so well.  The energy is pulled in and out in spectacular ways; halfway through, all we have is just a high hat keeping track of a ringing guitar and the repeating refrain… and then, of course, we kick back in to that wall of sound again.\nSoul Glo —&nbsp;23\n\nThis album is a masterpiece, but it's not for the faint of heart in both its lyric content and musical styling.  \"23\" is a collection of movements that epitomize hardcore punk in the best ways — it's low-fi, emotional, and a head-banger.\nThis album touches on the punk DIY scene, race, and relationships.  I'll let \"23\" speak for itself:\n\nEmotional assimilation is trauma […]\nIs trauma's worn, scar-tissued skin\nSeared by state-sanctioned aspirations\nUnderneath my will to live clings tight my will to die\nThe silent secret of my strength is all the shame I've centralized\n\nHappyness — Vegetable\n\nThere's two sides to this driven-but-soft, crunchy-but-acoustic, catchy tune.  It's a relatively conventional indie track, clearly rooted in Elliott Smith's tradition, with an extremely catchy hook and a straight-forward structure; but the way it bends back and forth from driven guitars to an acoustic crawl is really something spectacular.  The instrumentation itself heavily recalls indie rock of years past, but \"Vegetable\" is still novel.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202006-best/","title":"New Music:  June 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202007-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\n\nThe water rolls down the drain / \nOh, what a lonely thing in a lonely drain / \nJuly, July, July never seemed so strange\n\nIt's been mostly the same for us here.  Just work, life, and good new music.  Here's some descriptions of some of the tracks which I stumbled across this month that stood out to me.\nUltraísta — Harmony\n\nSister, Ultraísta's sophomore record, rules.  I had such a hard time picking just one song off of it.  The Atoms For Peace-like instrumentation blends with Laura Bettinson's vocals so well.  The album is just one fantastic cohesive piece; no one song is clearly the single.\nRight from the start, you know what you're getting into with \"Harmony\" — it starts off with a straight-forward clipping drum beat, then a melody in a mode I can't recognize transitions us into Laura Bettinson's perfect vocals.  Speaking of which:  the tone that she is able to invoke with her vocal chords is stunning.\n\"Harmony\" is a beautiful symphony which builds upon itself.  I don't know if the tempo increases as the song proceeds, but it almost sounds like it due to the way that the layering increases over time, punching the rhythm further and further.\nLittle Dragon — Hold On\n\nYou don't need me to tell you that Little Dragon has perfected the art of making a groove.  The bass line in this song is phenomenal, at some times sounding like a precision bass guitar, other times clearly a synthesizer.  The way that all of the other instruments make space for each other by being perfectly spaced apart is exceptional, particularly the bass, which doesn't ring out for maybe most of the song.\nRitual Union will always be one of my favorite albums, and I don't think it has been usurped as my favorite Little Dragon record, but doesn't mean that New Me, Same Us isn't an exceptional album.\nAngel Olsen — All Mirrors (Johnny Jewel remix)\n\nDang, that kick drum tone.\nAll Mirrors is a great record, and a collection of remixes supporting it was just released.\nJohnny Jewel's effort here is amazing.  The song is completely transformed into a real electropop hit, with belting vocals and a traditional synth line.  Some remixes merely paste over existing tracks; this one reworks it into something completely different.\nThis song is now something approaching an anthem.  I know I keep comparing songs to Robyn, but this track is definitely on the same tier.\nDeerhoof —&nbsp;O Ye Saddle Babes\n\nDeerhoof are such an amazing band.  I am a huge fan of the energy that their 2014 record La Isla Bonita brings with every track — especially \"Paradise Girls,\" which is one of the greatest songs ever written.  I'm definitely more of a fan of their more up-tempo tracks, and that record is chock-full of them.\n\"O Ye Saddle Babes\" is definitely up-tempo —&nbsp;it's quintessential Deerhoof, bringing the prototypical beautiful and shifting instrumentation into a groovy, cerebral, rocking package.\nAnd, of course, the lyrics are brilliant, as always:\n\nCan't we all just get along / little doggies? x4\nHow will you last / weather forecast cowboy?\nA new location with vegetation / yeah\nCowboys were just a corporate invention x3\n\nJay Som — Can't Sleep\n\n\"Can't Sleep\" is high-flying masterpiece.  The individual instrumentation has a veneer of analog to each part, creating a tape-like effect.  It's hard to understand Melina Duterte's vocals here because they're underneath a fair bit of distortion, but there's something emotionally moving in this song.  It's triumphant, but also sweet and sad.\nThere's no individual part from \"Can't Sleep\" that sticks out as the hook, but the first two-thirds of the song have a pop structure buried beneath a very cool lo-fi tradition.  Then, of course, there's the horn outro, which only serves to add to the cool factor.\nThe Orielles — Space Samba (Disco Valador Theme)\n\nEdgar Wright — you know, the guy from the movies — also picked this song for his appropriately titled playlist, \"EDGAR WRIGHT'S TOP 50 SONGS OF 2020 (PART 1),\" which should make a lot of sense.\nFor a disco song, \"Space Samba (Disco Valador Theme)\" feels kind of slow to me; not quite danceable, but still groovy and a good listen.  It's spacey and shiny, and I often put the record on in the background and it's over before I know it, giving my brain a gentle \"you can do it!\" with its grooves.\nSilverbacks — Muted Gold\n\nThere's so much going on in this song.  There are a bunch of disparate voices — a pastiche of extremely cool effects that come together so well.  The completely unexpected \"hoo, hah!\" which shows up about a minute and a half into the song is slightly unexpected, but not in a distracting way.  It works so well, and builds a tower of concepts that reach for the sky.\nYou can follow the motifs through each section, like the constant backbeat, astonishing guitar lines, and evocative vocals to bind the song together.  I'm glad that we revisit each part of the song in its structure, but there's no one point that clearly defines itself as the hook.\nAll of the things that make up this song, if slightly tweaked, could be jarring, but instead they're beautiful components which make up a beautiful song.\nNo Age – Turned To String\n\nThis song is the garage-rock version of someone sitting at the control panel of an impressive spaceship, flipping switches and turning the wheel at all the right times in order to accelerate to our mutual destination.  The layered guitars which toggle on and off are very powerful, especially the melodic tremolo that kicks in at the resolution of each section of the song.\nThe vocals, too, have a lot of force behind them — not quite punk-like, but clearly in a tradition that concerns itself with a punk timbre. \nAll of No Age's \"Goons Be Gone\" is this great — it's jam-packed with often-energetic, delightful jams.\nRolling Blackouts Coastal Fever — Cars In Space\n\nThis song makes me nod my head back and forth; it's energetic, with its clean guitar tones evoking clear movement.  It's passionate, leading up to a very fantastic guitar and horn lead-in to the not-quite chorus.  The structure isn't typical, but it's incredibly catchy and moving.\nThere's so much going on in the vocal intonations, the guitars combining in the background, down to the curiously-shifting backbeat.\nPlease do not put cars in space.\nCaleb Landry Jones — All I Am in You / The Big Worm\n\n\"All I Am in You / The Big Worm\" is a bit of a departure from the other tracks off of Jones' debut The Mother Stone in its more energetic nature.  But here, like the rest of the record, he puts on a handful of different voices, phasing into each other with a great driving sound.  This album is perpetually circus-like, but \"All I Am in You / The Big Worm\" is the \"Good Morning Good Morning\" track, if you will.\nI'll probably put this track in the same camp as \"Pa Pa Power\" by Dead Man's Bones — a surprisingly good, not-exactly-pop song from a famous actor.\nWhite Denim —&nbsp;I Don't Understand Rock and Roll\n\nMe neither, man.\nThis track is so catchy.  The hook was stuck in my head, playing over and over while I was trying to sleep just last night:\n\"I don't understand rock and roll, no no no, I don't understand, I don't understand, oh no no no…\"\nThis song definitely sounds the best when you crank up the volume and let the crunchy guitars surround you while James Patralli's surprisingly soft vocals sit right in the middle.\nRetirement Party — Fire Blanket\n\nGosh, what a heart-wrenching song.  \"Fire Blanket\" is a traditional emo song, and it puts the pieces together so well, with the guitar licks playing the perfect counter-harmony to Avery Springer's devastating vocals.\nI wish someone would make a new skateboarding game that grips the nation the same way that the Tony Hawk's (insert game here) series did — this song worthy of being firmly wedged in an entire generation's head in the same way as Jimmy Eat World's \"Pain.\"\nI love the structure of this song; again, it's traditional and not necessarily surprising, but it invokes just the right amount of repetition to be immediately catchy without being redundant.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202007-best/","title":"New Music:  July 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202008-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nWell, that's two-thirds of 2020 through.  I hope you're taking your time and enjoying things, despite everything going on.  Here's some songs that I really enjoyed this month.\nYumi Zouma — Right Track / Wrong Man\n\nYumi Zuma's new effort, Truth or Consequences, is spectacular.  It's electronic, poppy, soft, but still often danceable.\nI picked \"Right Track / Wrong Man\" here because it stands out to me as the most single-worthy track off of the record, but I'm surprised and delighted to find that other tracks of theirs are getting more attention online.  Great!\n\"Right Track / Wrong Man\" clocks in at just under 3 minutes, but it's so tight and cohesive that it feels much shorter.  It's a really neat package, with airy motifs that get stuck in my head.\nPreviously, I was a fan of their track \"Barricade (Matter of Fact),\" which almost feels like it's come from a different time.  Truth or Consequences is often happier, more triumphant than the previous Yumi Zouma tunes which I'm familiar with.\nilluminati hotties — content//bedtime\n\nIs FREE I.H: This Is Not the One You've Been Waiting For the best record ever made while under duress?  Quite possibly.  Am I doing something unethical by listening to this record in a way that will give Sarah Tudzin's former record company cash?\nSo many tracks off of this record are so catchy that I've woken up with them stuck in my head.  There's something comical about \"content//bedtime,\" but not in a distracting way.  It's honest and a type of punk that I love — caring and uncaring, pretty but with a jagged edge.\n\"content//bedtime\" in particular is brilliant.  The digitally-demolished eighty-seven-second-long intro, dancing polyrhythms, and the astonishing fake time signature shift in the chorus are legendary.\nAlso be sure to check out \"frequent letdown,\" which serves as a thematic motif for the rest of the record and will be permanently wedged in your head after the first time you listen to it.\nIf this isn't the one I've been waiting for, then I can't wait for the one I should have been.\nRolling Blackouts Coastal Fever — She's There\n\n\"She's There\" has a Built to Spill feel, with driven guitars dictating the pace and direction of the journey.  The vocal parts are incredibly gripping as well, a collection of clever hooks put together in shifting sections.\nThese Melbournians have put together a rocking collection of tracks, but \"She's There\" really stands out to me as one that will stick with me for a while.  It's timeless, but I feel like I'll look back on it and it'll sound just like some time having gone by.\nMelkbelly — THC\n\n\"THC\" kicks in immediately with a evil-sounding tone, but quickly gives away the nature of the game by shifting in and out of these metal-esque building sessions.  There's something dulcet underneath a layer of grunge and grime, especially when the ultra-catchy chorus kicks in.  It's a succinct track, though five minutes long; I often find it stuck in my head, the chorus playing over and over again.\nHovvdy — Runner\n\n\"Runner\" is such a moving track; I feel a physical weight in my heart from the very beginning, and I can't quite pin down why.  Maybe it's the instrumentation and chord structure, maybe it's the low-fi, double-tracked vocals mixed in with a cool but almost early-2000s atmosphere.  You know those songs that got popular because of The O.C.?  This song is like that, but better.\nThis track is emotive and a great achievement, and I'm looking forward to the album that it will support.\nFontaines D.C. — Living In America\n\nA Hero's Death is a smashing record.  It's dark and crunchy; it's an album to listen to while getting things done, as long as you don't stop to think too hard about the troubling thoughts that the lyrics often point to.\nGrian Chatten's vocals have such character, with a timbre that misleads your ear into gliding past his technical ability.\nI think I've said this before, but some music takes difficulty as a substitute for aesthetic pleasure; execution of tasks instead of generating something universally beautiful.  A Hero's Death is both:  every part of the instrumentation is so spot-on and challenging, but coming together to an engaging work of art.  And \"Living In America\" is my favorite example of this off of this record — it's challenging and beautiful.\nGhostpoet — Nowhere To Hide Now\n\nEvery track off of I Grow Tired But Dare Not Fall Asleep is so, so good, but \"Nowhere To Hide Now\" really sticks out for me.  It gives me the chills every time.\nAnd just wait until the vocals kick in. Ghostpoet's vocal stylings have so much emotion behind them, acting out the story on top of a spooky, cabaret-like soundscape.\nI highly recommend this album — listen to the title track \"I Grow Tired But Dare Not Fall Asleep\" next.\nSecret Machines — Everything Starts\n\nEverything in this track comes in pairs, which play against each other:  the guitars pinging off of each other, the octave-split, sometimes diverging vocals; the double-tracked call-and-response.\nAs you may have noticed, I like songs that invoke a lot of emotion.  I feel like some folks might not get this one, because this song does seem to rely on a lot of tropes to get to a tragic atmosphere.  But… I like that.  A lot.  It's still novel, in the way that every song must rely on tropes and mimetic tools while still striking off on their own enough.\nThis song tells a moving story, and I absolutely adore it.\nCoriky — Hard to Explain\n\nIan MacKaye's vocals have a sharp edge which contrasts so well with the its soft surroundings on this track.  Imagine if The Offspring and The New Pornographers made a supergroup.  That's the best way I can describe this track, which is, well, erm, hard to explain.\nI love the way this track packs a big punch by shifting in and out of big and quiet, always playing on the same theme but weaving in and out of it.\nFlat Worms — The Aughts\n\n\nNow everybody's talkin' 'bout the aughts, the tens, the teens /\nOnly a means to an end\n\nThis song rules.  Play it loud.  For the vast majority of this track, the bass line is riffing off of a single note, bouncing on an octave, and it is extremely cool.\nEverything gives space to everything else — the vocals gesture over to the guitar, then the guitar nods back to the vocals, each giving each other permission to take off.  The drums have this impressive, ballistic flair to them, especially in those tiny fills in the normal line in the verse.  It all comes together to this loud package.\nAnother ripper of a track off of this record is \"Market Forces,\" a well-rounded jam which I also can't get enough of.\nThe Beths — I'm Not Getting Excited\n\nI am!\nElizabeth Stokes' vocals fit in so well with the frenzied symphony which carry them, providing the hook and the justification for everything else to rock out for a solid nearly three minutes, even in the almost-pop-punk parts where everybody drops out.\nIt's catchy, and feels much shorter than it is, because the instrumentation is so tight and put together.\nHum — Waves\n\nHum's Spotify bio is almost entirely:\n\nRock music\n\nI think that's lovely, and not quite right.  They rock, but Hum is this fantastic, shoegazey post-punk.  All of the instruments move as one.  This is another one of those tracks that's not quite metal, taking all of the right motifs to make technical sound that harnesses a chaotic energy and somehow plays it cool and slow.\nAlso, what a great album cover.\nLand of Talk — Diaphanous\n\nI stumbled across Land of Talk's most recent record, Indistinct Conversations, after suddenly getting their 2008 track \"Some Are Lakes\" stuck in my head at least once a day and looking up the band to see what they've gotten up to lately.\n12 years later, Indistinct Conversations is a collection of soft questions.  \"Diaphanous\" is not quite a lullaby, but it's sweet and sad.  It knows to hold the thread of the conversation in just the right way in order to create something floating and engaging.\nAnother Sky — All Ends\n\nAnother Sky have an extremely distinct style.  I admit that I wasn't immediately engaged on my first listen through I Slept On The Floor, but I'm glad I gave it another shot, because it has quickly become one of my favorite albums from 2020.\nAnother Sky are clearly a project.  There's a specific atmosphere being crafted and invoked throughout this whole record, and they have it dialed.  And really, that atmosphere won't be for everyone — I implore you to leave your prejudices at the door and to give it a real shot.\n\"All Ends,\" in particular, will tug at your heartstrings, if you let it.\nOn the other end of the rock spectrum of this album is another favorite of mine, \"Fell In Love With The City,\" which repeats its refrain and really drives home the wall of sound that Another Sky has built.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202008-best/","title":"New Music:  August 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202009-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nIt's been an exceptional month for music.  I don't know if it's just that I've gotten lucky with all of the tracks I've stumbled across, or if there's really just been a surge of new records and singles that will be my favorites for years to come, but I'm not going to think about it too hard — I'm just going to enjoy them and take the opportunity to share some of them with you right now!\nPedro The Lion, American Football, Nick Wilkerson, Dragon Inn 3 — Yer Brothers\n\nI typically write these articles while listening to the playlist, touching on each track as it comes up.  But my first pass through this playlist, it took almost the entire length of this track to figure out how to accurately represent its byline.\nThis entire record is just astonishing.  It was really hard for me to just pick one track off of it, but ultimately \"Yer Brothers\" stuck out for me the most.\nI really love the mission here, that Polyvinyl's artists basically came together and made something great out of the Great Reshuffling to All of Our Lives that is still underway.  It's a star-studded record, and it shows:  other standouts feature vocals from Yumi Zuma and Matt Pond PA.\n\"Yer Brothers\" is delightful, a poppy, melodic, slightly sad anthem.  I can imagine it being the soundtrack to some part of my life, but I just don't know which one.  That haunting pad sound which was chosen for the melodic motif is just so good and catchy; it's a song full of hooks, making it sound slightly poppy, but in a great way.  It's complex, but approachable.  Just like the rest of the record — there's a lot going on, but it's a cohesive, excellent whole.\nPsymon Spine feat. Barrie —&nbsp;Milk\n\nRight away, when the vocals kick in, you'll know exactly how \"Milk\" is going to go.  It's an electronic funk with, as far as I can tell, the only \"electronic\" instrument in the first verse being the drum pad.\nI'm particularly a fan of the evocative nature of the verses; there's just something about Barrie Lindsay's vocals that play the role of the song's presenter so well.\nIt's fun and evocative, and I'm excited to see what else Psymon Spine do soon!\nJacknife Lee feat. Open Mike Eagle —&nbsp;Make It Weird\n\nThis hip-hop jam is so driven by its precise, ear-catching percussion, and, of course, Open Mike Eagle's cool, clever lines.\nSetting aside the perfect instrumentation and the tone which could never be even remotely approached by another pair of artists, it's really rare that I relate so hard to the lyrics of a song:\n\nCaught in between the realms of what's real /\nPeoples' perceptions vs. what I feel /\nMost of the time it's just in my head /\nBut I still obsess on the words that I said\n\nThen, later:\n\nI can get embarrassed in thousands of ways /\nAnd I hold that feeling for two or three days /\nEverybody else is up and moved on /\nAnd I'm still here thinkin' about why I'm wrong\n\nKate NV — Plans\n\nRoom For The Moon is such a great record.  It's very slightly lo-fi, but still fantastically produced.  \"Plans\" is in Russian, but I've counted four different languages on this record, and I'm sure I've missed at least one.\nIt's hard to describe what it is exactly that I love about \"Plans\" — maybe it's the ever-shifting nature, with three or four repeating motifs that blend so well into each other.  Maybe it's the sweet and powerful vocals, or the ever-churning, popping bass.  Like the rest of the album, this track is playful, but with a purpose, and it comes together so well into something artful.\nNation of Language —&nbsp;Gouge Away\n\nThis is the third month this year that Nation of Language have featured in this article.  But I don't feel bad that fully one-third of all of these articles this month have sung Nation of Language's praises.  I now fully believe that they're going to be the next breakout indie stars.  And they certainly will, if they keep releasing such great singles, EPs, and records at this rate — at least I'll keep talking about them as they come out!\nThis Pixies cover is exactly what we've come to expect from Nation of Language, with their incredibly new-but-clearly-new-wave take on one from Doolittle.\nDevaney's Black Francis impression is a little more Issac Brock as he kicks us kick us into the chorus.  The structure of this song is so spectacular, and this effort at it is as catchy as it could possibly be.\nWoods —&nbsp;Can't Get Out\n\nI think this track's going to be immensely popular, and for good reason.  It's incredibly catchy, and its carnivalesque, rolling tones bring something joyful to lyrics that point to something much more tragic.  It's ear-catching in a great way, possibly because of the well-designed layering — seriously, take a good hard listen for the single pinging piano note plunging its way through the verse.  Somehow, they've found the perfect tones to shape around Jeremy Earl's unique vocal timbre.\nSweeping Promises — Hunger for a Way Out\n\n\"Hunger for a Way Out\" is such a jam that I made a playlist of songs that I felt went along well with it, which I've titled \"🎸👩🏼‍🎤🥁⚡\".  The catchy chorus is inspiring; it's the perfect track to have on in the background in just about any circumstance where you want to feel its energy.\nThis album is so good.  Every track brings a new kind of voltage, a new twist on an incredible, distorted tone that I clearly have an affinity for.  Check out \"An Appetitie\" next, with an astonishing bassline rounding out the floor as the guitar and vocals play on top of it.  Honestly, just listen to the whole album!\nLithics — Tower Of Age\n\n\"Tower Of Age\" is short and punchy, with discordant parts which come together in a very cool, somehow still melodic whole.  It's like the very high-up bassline, guitar, other guitar, and vocals touch on the same note far less often than most songs, but create these chords at the exact right moment to sound like pure energy.\nWares — Tall Girl\n\nFew tracks are so heart-wrenching while also creating such a driving wall of sound.  Something about this song fills me with what can only be pretentiously described as \"weltschmerz,\" an actual heavy feeling in my chest.  The chorus — especially the chorus — wails on every side of my thoughts and feelings.\nI'm saying a lot about the evocative nature of the song and not a lot about its instrumentation — it's a slower Scott Pilgrim jam; it's conventional indie, but with its own take on the many parts that make up this big tent of a genre.\n\"Last I heard / last I saw / you had a job at the mall\" is the perfect snippet from this song; it's such a weird lyric, but it still makes me feel something like a nostalgia for a life that I never had.\nOceanator —&nbsp;I Would Find You\n\nOceanator's \"I Would Find You\" is a straight-forward, conventional, poppy rock track, with combinations of extremely catchy hooks and cool tones.  The message is sweet, and the track itself has a very high chance of getting firmly wedged in your head.\nThis one's almost like The Cars, but with something immensely fresh and new.\nDeath Bells — Heavenly Bodies\n\nDeath Bells have found a hit in \"Heavenly Bodies,\" a driven, slightly brooding track with one of the catchiest choruses I've ever heard.  It's a shame that this track won't be played in an arena until we can go back into arenas again, because I want to be inside any arena that's cool enough to let this song blare.\nThe overdrive on the guitar churning out the chord structure through single, percussive beats, transitioning to an extremely compelling syncopation with the rest of the track is so smart, and yet it's only one thing that could stand out from this track when you give it a listen.\nGhum —&nbsp;Saturn\n\n\"Ghum\" is a spectral, cinematic soundscape.  You can get hints of eras of goth rock in this track, combined with newer traditions from groups like Savages.\nI absolutely love that guitar tone, where the overdrive and reverb are so great that it's hard to even recognize the instrument as a guitar anymore.  The vocal hooks are perfect in \"Saturn\" — each individual part creates such a cool, spooky atmosphere.\nDoves —&nbsp;Broken Eyes\n\nThere's just something about this song that conveys a lot of emotion and has completely hooked me.  The chorus, especially, is beautiful and sad, but above all else, immensely catchy.  And those precise drums laying down a steady, predictable line with a very cool 16th-note flourish certainly round out the rest of the track, making room for the vocals to really lay the foundation for the argument that the track makes.\nYoung Jesus — Faith\n\n\"Faith\" is a track that comes in at just over seven minutes, and it's worth every second.  The heavily-modulated vocals fit the more traditional five-piece-sounding instrumentation which slowly kicks up into something slightly more electronic or experimental.  The guitar tones fly and rock, and then suddenly the song transitions into something a little slower and more tragic, then, of course, build back up again in a powerful way.  The sections of this song create a spectacular narrative.\nBUMPER —&nbsp;Black Light\n\nWe all know that Japanese Breakfast's Michelle Zauner is extremely good at what she does.  This is exactly more of that, but with a much more electronic feel; it's almost City Pop.  The percussive synths fit so well with Zauner's voice.  There's a lot going on in this track, but the project is very clear and it works very well.  The chorus is incredibly catchy, with a cascade of tones crashing together.\nTunng — A Million Colours\n\nWell, Tunng have certainly done it again with this one.  This track, like most of Tunng's others, is definitely well-described by calling it \"future folk.\"  There's something so immediately re-representable in this song — if sung a capella, without the gorgeous backing symphony, it would be simultaneously exactly the same but completely different.\nIt's so powerful; the production quality is so amazing, pointing to the parts which make up the track by fading or dropping in or out at just the right moment.  Especially during the chorus, allowing the vocal choir to really take off makes the whole track so gripping.\nIf this single is any indication, DEAD CLUB will be perfect.\nInner Wave — Estrella\n\nIt takes a minute for \"Estrella\" to kick in from the intro, but as soon as the heavily side-chained rhythm kicks in, you feel the funk.  The adorable, also incredibly side-chained layered \"children shouting\" effect works so well, and there is no other way to describe it.  (You'll hear it.)\nThe vocals sit in a really great part of this mix, but I can't imagine anyone trying to listen to this track in any way but loud.\nNormally, I don't really like very popular over-reliance on side chaining that will undoubtedly be the defining feature of the music of this era.  It's not as though I feel like it's in any way low-brow or unworthy of my time, it's just that I find it incredibly distracting.  Seriously, it's hard to have a conversation with other people when the speakers are toggling on and off so rapidly and loudly.  I mostly listen to music while doing other things, mostly writing code — heavily side-chained tracks take me out of the flow so much that I have to skip them.\nThis is all to say that \"Estrella\" is perfectly balanced.  It uses so many pop motifs in a new, beautiful way; it's novel, but still so catchy.\nKelly Lee Owens —&nbsp;Wake-Up\n\nInner Song, Owens' most recent record, is a collection of electronica masterpieces.  \"Wake-Up\" is one of the more conventional, indie-like tracks, which means that it's no surprise that it ended up standing out the most from the record for me.\nIt's downtempo and slightly sad, with the layered pads highlighting Owens' voice in such a smart, devastating way.  The motifs that are repeated; like the cascading echo of the hook from the chorus, make all of the combined parts sound clean and new.  It's just such a smart, touching song, and it's a lovely way to round out the album as the last track.\n\"Corner Of My Sky\" also shouldn't be missed.  It's a fantastic, meandering collaboration with avant-garde rocksmith John Cale; it's a surprising trip.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202009-best/","title":"New Music:  September 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202010-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nIt's Halloween when I'm wrapping this article up, and let me tell you, you're going to be spooked by how great these new tracks are!  🎃\nIn all seriousness, I can't believe how fast time is flying by.  I'm sure I'll hear these songs in the future and they'll remind me of this particular time in the world:  the weather getting colder, the world on a precipice, but still new songs to enjoy.\nI LIKE TRAINS —&nbsp;Desire is a Mess\n\nI LIKE TRAINS's KOMPROMAT came out just in time for Halloween.  \"Desire is a Mess\" is just one incredible track from a series of many — you should definitely give this one a try cover-to-cover, not just for how fantastic each track is, but the way the band have obviously worked hard to make sure each track flows so well into the next.\n\"Desire is a Mess\" is such an amazing track.  Turn it up loud.  It is clearly not a dance song, and it's not a head-banger, but somehow it's both at the same time.  It is and is not a fight song.  It rules.  Especially the parts where the track lets itself pull the energy down by getting a little more quiet — what an incredible move to make that final refrain that much more exciting and amplified.\nI could go on for days about the smart decisions made by this song:  the haunting distortion which blends in and out of this song.  That dirty bassline that did not have to be so cool.  The unsettling double-track effect on the already well-acted vocals.  The blend of digital and analog that blurs the lines between tape and live action.  That incredible bassline.\nIt's spooky and cool and you do not want to miss this record.\nFEWS — Heaven\n\nTake the best parts of shoegaze and that sort of not-quite-punk punk indie that came out of a few years ago and you get \"Heaven,\" a spectacular, ripping wall of sound.  Take one of the more energetic Slowdive songs and imagine that FIDLAR decided to do a respectful job with it.\nIf you don't think that sounds amazing, then I have only one piece of advice:  please allow yourself to have fun.  No, two:  check this track out.\nThe parts that make up the whole of this track are interesting, but the thing that stands out the most is this sort of spooky melodic line that plays over the refrain; it has so much reverb and sustain that you can barely make it out over the top of the crunchy, driving guitar underneath it, but it's incredibly gripping.\nSPICE — FIRST FEELING\n\nSPICE SEEM TO EXCLUSIVELY USE CAPITAL LETTERS EVERYWHERE YOU TURN, BUT THIS DOESN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE A \"CAPS LOCK\" TRACK OR ALBUM.  THEIR MOTTO SEEMS TO BE \"SPICE IS PAIN,\" WHICH I THINK POINTS TO THE OFTEN HEARTFELT AND WRENCHING THEMES APPARENT IN ALL OF THEIR SONGS.  BUT THIS DOES NOT SOUND EXACTLY THE WAY YOU MIGHT THINK IT WOULD SOUND.\n\"FIRST FEELING\" IS A BEAUTIFUL, DEEP SONG, PUSHING THE BOUNDARIES OF EMO AND ROCK.  THE WHOLE ALBUM SHARES THIS TRACK'S FANTASTIC MANAGEMENT OF THE EMOTIVE MOVEMENTS OF DRUMS, GUITAR, KEYS, AND ROSS FARRAR'S GRITTY VOCALS.  BUT \"FIRST FEELING\" IS A HIT — IT'S LIKE POST-POST-POST-EMO'S LOGICAL NEXT STEP.\nSuburban Living — No Roses\n\nSuburban Living has, apparently, roughly followed the same track in life that I have, hailing from (roughly) Virginia Beach and currently calling Philadelphia home.  But I ended up mostly setting down the guitar, while Suburban Living has recently released a phenomenal record.\nThis sprawling, cinematic track takes fully two minutes and eight seconds for the vocals to kick in, which is a decision in service of the atmosphere this track builds up.  I often find myself getting sucked in, completely engrossed by the paths that the melody lead you down.\nOnce the vocals kick in, the song becomes immensely catchy.  \"No Roses\" is almost an anthem — in a better world, it would be played on the radio, a song to listen to when you need a triumphant moment.\n2nd Grade — Dennis Hopper in Easy Rider\n\nPhiladelphians 2nd Grade apparently all came together to write a collection of not-quite-jingles called Hit to Hit, and I curse them for it, because many of them are permanently wedged inside my brain and I will sing them until I die.\n\"Dennis Hopper\" is perpetually stuck in my head.  It's clever and fun, in a They Might Be Giants kind of way.  Exercise caution, because once you commit to recording this track upon your soul, there is no going back.\nAnother smash hit from this album is \"Baby's First Word\" — just as clever as the rest, and infinitely fun.  Oh, and \"Shooting From the Hip,\" another one that goes round and round in my head all the time.\nOkay Kaya — Psych Ward\n\nWith one of the coolest bass lines to come out of 2020, \"Psych Ward\" is intentionally approachable while also completely unsettling.  I'd only known of Okay Kaya from her track on the Death Stranding soundtrack, but this is completely different; a four-piece style romp that already seems to have garnered a bit of attention in the short time it's been since the track was released.\nThe subject of the song is exactly what the title implies; it's slightly comical, but not disrespectful.  The song ends up feeling much shorter than it actually is due to its abbreviated structure, and I think that's great.  \"Psych Ward\" is a lovely, fun romp, and well worth your attention.\nLomelda — Hannah Sun\n\n\"Hannah Sun\" is such a lovely, heart-wrenching song.  The more folk-like instrumentation, Hannah Read's unique vocals, and the spectacular layering synth sound combine so well.  There's a semi-subtle bit of layering that kicks in as the volume drives up, a haunting, resonating quarter note that hangs out on the tonic of the melody and just makes the whole song feel spectacular.\nThis is perfect songwriting; there's peaks and valleys, and it's as if the common tradition that's being conveyed here is pointing to a more basic song that exists within all of us.  I know that sounds a bit trite, but I have no other way of justifying the way this song makes me feel both triumphant and sad at the same time!\nWesterman — The Line\n\nYour Hero Is Not Dead is such a spectacular album, but \"The Line\" really stands out to me as a breakout hit.\nI want to add this quote from Westerman's current bio on Spotify:\n\nLike a young Peter Gabriel in a late-capitalist world, Westerman's music falls somewhere between artful soft rock and confessional electronic pop.\n\nI mean, I'm not going to do a better job of describing his work than that quote does!  But here I go, attempting to try anyway.\nWhen you listen to Your Hero Is Not Dead all the way through, it will become clear why I chose \"The Line,\" one of the more energetic, less esoteric tracks.  That doesn't diminish the work of the other tracks, though; I just found this one standing out as both better suited to be jumbled in with a bunch of other more uptempo songs, and also more of an ear worm for me than the other ones.\n\"The Line\" is delightful, a sailing series of lines puzzled together in often surprising ways.  There is a distinctly 80s-meets-2020s vibe to this track, but not necessarily in the way that you're used to hearing.  I haven't put this track on my \"Not Tears For Fears\" playlist, for example, because it doesn't sound like it's that influenced by Tears For Fears (though, arguably, every song is).\nI'm saying a lot of what this song isn't, and once you listen to this song, you'll understand why.  It's ethereal while still grounded by the parts of a song that you're used to hearing.\nKatie Dey — Dancing\n\nMelbournian Katie Day's latest record is a brooding but bright collection of electropop.  \"Dancing\" is really a standout track for me, a song which poses questions with its every movement.  The rolling not-quite strings which evolve into more string-sounding pads are exceptionally crafted; the advancing distortion on the lead pad is a powerful touch that reflects powerful vocals.\nAnd, of course, it would be a crime to not mention that the chorus has something indescribably powerful inside.\n\nI will ruin everything I love but I need you\nTo be my choreographer\nDance until everything hurts\nI can take it, I am stronger than you think\n\nBecca Mancari — Hunter\n\nThis is an incredibly catchy track, which has already deservedly become immensely popular.  All of the guitar effects are so amazing here — that crunchy, fuzzy guitar perfectly separated from the rest of the instrumentation by an incredibly amount of space plays so well with… well, honestly, I can barely tell if it's a guitar in the background creating that wah-wah percussive effect, but it's good.\nThere's so much happening in this track, and I think that's a lot of what contributes to it being so catchy.  The vocals are straight-forward, but not simple, and they play the perfect counterpoint to other parts of the track which do a lot of heavy lifting.  This song is basically built like a metal song, but as indie pop from 2020.\nWorking Men's Club — John Cooper Clarke\n\nShout-out to Devin for hearing this record and knowing that it's my exact taste in music.  This whole record is phenomenal, with so many tracks that I could have picked to write about.\nIt's immensely danceable, but also serious and sounds like, well, music to get work done to.  The pads and guitars combine so well in this track, as does Sydney Minsky-Sargeant's \"I'm mostly talking, but sort of singing, and then mostly singing sometimes\" vocal stylings.\nA fitting tribute to the punk poet for sure.  Also, check out \"Valleys\" and \"Teeth\" next.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202010-best/","title":"New Music:  October 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202011-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nNo, \"Alice's Restaurant\" didn't make it onto the list this month, but I hope you'll enjoy these ten great tracks that were new to me this month all the same!\nJessie Ware — Ooh La La\n\nI had a really hard time picking just one track off of this masterpiece of a record.  And listen, this album has clearly taken off, and I'm very late to the party, but it deserves all of the hype it'll get.\n\"Ooh La La\" is a standout track for me.  The groove is immense, with a fantastic bass line, beautiful cascading sound effects with wailing, distant guitars, and, of course, Ware's astonishing vocals.\nI want to blare this track driving through the city at night with the top rolled down, and that, to me, is almost exactly what this track — and really, entire album — was designed for.\nThe Dirtbombs — Sharevari (Cybernedit)\n\nAvalon Emerson's eclectic mixtape, DJ-Kicks, could not be more perfect.  It will almost certainly end up being one of my favorite records of the year, but I'm a little surprised that this album doesn't violate some sort of copyright law.  I think I'm kind of breaking an unspoken rule of this blog by including a 2020 mix of a 2011 cover of a track from 2000, but it's new to me!\n\"Sharevari\" is such a jam.  It's gritty but fun, an extreme groove that is immensely danceable.  It comes in near the end of the record, kicking the energy up a gear again, but certainly stands alone as its own track.  If you include it in your next mixtape, it'll surely impress.\nTom Vek — Slippery Fish\n\nTom Vek is back!  I was so excited to see this album come out, because Luck is one of my favorite albums.\nThis one is a bit less energetic than Vek's three previous records.  There's still something experimental to each track, but the dial has been turned down just a little bit.  And that's fine!  I think one of the primary criticisms of Tom Vek's work is that to the impatient, it might come across as a bit like a Nokia ringtone.  But fooey to the folks who do not know how to have fun and enjoy the piercing lead lines of \"Sherman (Animals in the Jungle)\" — and even if you don't enjoy his typical work, New Symbols might be a welcome departure.\n\"Slippery Fish\" is a contemplative but still energetic groove, asking questions with its clever lyrics but keeping us grounded with an extremely cool composition.  I keep getting random snippets from this track stuck in my head, but that is, for me, completely expected from Tom Vek's work.\nHAERTS — It's Too Late\n\n\"It's Too Late\" kicks in with ethereal pads which are quickly taken up by Nini Fabi's iconic vocals; a jazzy tune with a great mix of classic indie instrumentation blended with some surprising elements.  There's a little bongo kick in the chorus, which is joined the second time around by the expected percussive elements like, of course, the cowbell.\nThis track has a fun groove, while maintaining a brooding atmosphere, and I'm excited for the record that this single will support!\nHachiku — I'll Probably Be Asleep\n\n\"I'll Probably Be Asleep\" is cinematic and clearly composed; a ripper of a rock song with gothic undertones.  Hachiku's double-tracked, reverbed, spacey vocals are absolutely gripping, playing so well off of guitars and feedback which fit into the space left around the track so well.  The selective use of a variety of levels of grit on the guitar, and a whole suite of organ tones let this track shift in and out of that ocean of sound.\nAlso, we have to talk about that incredible backline.  The way the drums switch in and out between a digital hi-hat and a technical shuffle on the toms fits the atmosphere of the track perfectly; and the bass sits so well in the mix that I can't ever really pick it out unless the song wants me to.\nМолчат Дома — Ленинградский блюз\n\nMolchat Doma's brand-new record, Monument, is just as much of a masterpiece as Этажи (Etazhi), their iconic second album.  But I'm honestly a little surprised that \"Leningradskiy Blues\" wasn't picked as a single to support this record.  This song is very slightly a departure from the rest of the record, while still maintaining that lo-fi but still deliberately considered tone.  The deep mystery that Molchat Doma create with each of their tracks comes out in \"Leningradskiy Blues\" as well, but there's a different kind of passion here than the rest of their work.\nThe overlaid melodic guitars are such a masterful stroke to go with the brooding vocals, which, of course, pair well with the expected bass and electronic drum-kit tones.  This track, like the rest of their work, is just immensely cool.\nAdulkt Life — New Curfew\n\nLook at that album cover!  Now that's pretty slick.\nThe structure of \"New Curfew\" is cyclical but not traditional, just like the guitar line that opens the track.  There's not necessarily any part of the track that stands out as the hook, but taken as a cohesive hole, this track is more of an experience in post-rock as opposed to the more pop-oriented, catchy track that most music points toward.\nThis track lays a foundation of minimalism which it quickly departs from — basically, setting up this math-like tone in order to knock it down with a punch of a B section.  This song doesn't describe \"fun\" things, but it clearly comes across as a jam; hopefully Adulkt Life has as much fun playing this track as it feels like it should be!\nGRMLN — Hey Cool Kid\n\nI will admit that I haven't had a lot of experience with Carpark's catalog, but this cover of \"Hey Cool Kid\" by Cloud Nothings takes one of my favorite songs and makes it even better.  By stripping back the distortion from the vocals while making the guitar effects sound maybe slightly more modern, there's a little bit more of a surf-rock feel, while still retaining much of the energy from the original.\nThis track is a great homage, making it slightly more technical, but still just as fun.\nGardens &amp; Villa — Disco Kitchen\n\nI love this track for its combination of stylings that I can't quite pin down:  the opening movements of the track might mislead you into thinking that you were about to listen to a French pop song, while the chorus isn't out of place from some of the more experimental, distorted pop indie from the 2010s.  The wall of sound that this track builds up to is deeply engaging and hard to put down.\nI particularly love the warbling synth tones which substitute in for the bass line, giving this track a technical, bouncy feel; that one line is a great microcosm for the way this track sets up the pins to knock them down.\nPom Poko — Like A Lady\n\nDang this song rocks.\nThat first kick which drops out to Ragnhild Fangel Jamtveit's soft vocals is such a great way to foreshadow the rock that's to come.  And seriously, that chorus —&nbsp;it's like the best energetic Deerhoof song built into a poppier bundle that I just love.\nThe way that everything is just slightly double-tracked, with each line departing from itself at key moments, is so gripping.  Oh, did I mention Jamtveit's amazing vocals?  The range that she controls in this track is astonishing; I challenge anyone to try to match that technical ability while still sounding fantastic.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202011-best/","title":"New Music:  November 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202012-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nWell, it's the end of 2020.  I'm honestly surprised that I had found so many tracks this month after my music habits this month were so outside the norm I established in the months prior, but I'm glad to be able to share this playlist with you, completely free of Christmas music.\n… But I will unofficially mention Glüme's \"Santa Baby,\" a real ripper of a take on that Christmas staple.\nNana Adjoa — National Song\n\nThere's just something about \"National Song\" that grabs your heartstrings and refuses to let go, slowly falling down an infinite, imperceptible chasm with you.\nI'd be hard-pressed to find a track that better conveys the emotion of the questions inherent in its lyrics with its instrumentation — the questions of identity, tradition, and power that must necessarily be difficult to discuss are supremely reflected by this gut-wrenching song.\nAt the very end of the track, the already wide bass line fills out the rest of the bottom of the space, taking on a special type of distortion and accelerating the movement of the rest of the repeating refrain completely on its own, shifting that bottom line to completely collapse the chord structure into something completely different.  It's a brilliant strategy, and it fits into the thematic motifs of the track so, so well.\n\n\nCherry Glazerr —&nbsp;Rabbit Hole\n\nIt is extremely cool that Cherry Glazerr is still churning out the hits, perfectly riding the wave of experimentation within the sound of the time that each track is released.  If you were to listen to \"Rabbit Hole\" on its own, you may have a hard time connecting it to two of their other tracks which make the list of my all-time favorites:  \"Told You I'd Be with the Guys\" and \"Had Ten Dollaz.\"\n\"Rabbit Hole\" is incredibly fun, but still slightly mysterious; it has a lot of that same energy of some of Glazerr's older tracks, just in a completely different platform.  And of course, Clementine Creevy's vocals are a standout star, completely placing the performance of each line into the best place it could possibly be placed — and, of course, much like the rest of Cherry Glazerr's catalog, this song is catchy as heck.\nHONEYMOAN — Too Much\n\n\"Too Much\" is a sort of hybrid masterpiece of pop, electronic, and rock —&nbsp;there's these ripping driving tones that come out of nowhere after a really fun combination of jangle, a nearly drum machine beat, and a bass which rounds everything out.\nThat chorus really stands out to me; it's not overly overdriven, and it stands in massive contrast to the rest of the song, but it doesn't feel out of place.  It's fun, and I can imagine that it's a real shredding feeling when it's played live.\nThis Is The Kit — This Is What You Did\n\nIt's hard to explain why \"This Is What You Did\" makes me feel so emotional, but maybe it's the combination of Kate Stables's fantastic vocal take and the unique structure of the song.  The combination of the banjo and lightly overdriven guitar which kicks in in the chorus play so well off of the slight rhythmic fluctuations which move around the main vocal line.\nAnd, of course, there are few songs that aren't improved by an ethereal saxophone solo.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for this \"future folk\" tone, but this, like every other song I would even begin to refer to as future folks is simply hard to categorize.  It's outside the norm, but not jarring.  It's innovative, and \"This Is What You Did\" sticks with you for all the right reasons.\nLauren Auder — june 14th\n\nThis track from Lauren Auder is astonishingly powerful.  Their vocals play a perfect partner to the resonant orchestration which draws chords in the air, creating a song that's evocative and emotive.\nThe mechanical aspects of the song are all completely perfect, but there's something about Auder's lyrics and performance that make the entire thing extraordinarily cinematic.  This track is clearly orchestrated, and built in order to move you, and it does its job incredibly well —&nbsp;especially with that extremely sweet and crushing piano take at the end which just puts a bow on the rest of the heart-wrenching package.\nSamantha Crain — Pastime\n\n\"Pastime\" is such a lovely track, with Crain's vocals the star player in powerful track that plays on the line between acoustic and electronic.  The pop-like structure has subtle twists and turns which make it immensely catchy and novel.  And gosh, if that chorus isn't extremely cool, with the rising vocal line and impressive instrumentation.\nIt was hard for me to pick just one track off this album, A Small Death —&nbsp;another one I must mention is the Choctaw-language \"When We Remain,\" an acoustic story of a song which is just as gripping as the rest of the tracks on the record.\nNight Shop — Hello Take Me Anywhere\n\n\"Hello Take Me Anywhere\" has such a cool twelve-bar groove.  Justin Sullivan's half-shouted vocals are super, driving the track just like its punchy snare hits, making it impossible not to bob your head along to the rhythm.\nThe chorus which kicks in in the chorus is lovely and sweet, but still fit in so well with this sort of \"cruisin' with the top down\" vibe; and though the guitar solo doesn't have any particular element that I can point to other than its fun play with that piano underlay, it just works so well with the rest of the track.\nNarrow Head — Stuttering Stanley\n\nI have a hard time pining this track down to any one particular genre; it's kind of noise rock, it's definitely not shoegaze, though you could see it kind of pointing in that direction, it's not post-emo or post- anything, but you'll know what I'm saying when you hear it.\nThe atmosphere of this song is slightly dark, but there's something still incredibly honest and playful about it, especially in the backing vocals of the chorus.\nPVA — Exhaust / Surroundings\n\nThis is just an extraordinarily cool track.  It starts off a bit soft and quiet, then the powerful pads kick in — the atmosphere reads something like the background to a huge moment in a really cool video game.  Ella Harris's vocals, in particular, are mysterious and perfect for the dark and spooky tone that slowly builds as the song progresses.  Each part rolls perfectly into the next, particularly the dueling vocals.\nPVA seem to be really early in their career together as a group, and I'm excited to see what else they release together!\nJayda G — Both Of Us\n\n\"Both of Us\" is a recent release, but it's already exploding across the airwaves — what remains of the airwaves — on its merit as a dance hit.  There's so much movement behind this combination of traditional dance techniques and Jayda G's unique vocals and production; it's dynamic, but always danceable, even when the tempo shifts down.  It's powerful, but not distracting.\nOne listen and I'm sure you'll know exactly which of your playlists you'll want to put this track on!\nJad &amp; The — Space Infinitum\n\nThis track is a little more House than the typical tracks that I feature in this article, but the groove here is undeniable.  This song went straight onto my \"electronic music to listen to while I work\" playlist — it's uptempo and motivational, it's fun and engaging, but it can sit in the background and push your brain forward while you get stuff done.\nThe symphony of instrumentation is so well mixed across this album, but this track is a real stand out to me for the way that the traditional dance effects blend in and out of the soundscape; it's put together so well, and when it's played loud, each independent part is unique but part of a powerful whole.\nIt's rare that I include a song without vocals on this playlist, but I thought that it had far too good of a groove not to share it!\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202012-best/","title":"New Music:  December 2020"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202101-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nWelcome to the second year of these articles!  I hope you enjoy these songs as much as I did.\nLost Horizons (feat. Kavi Kwai) — Every Beat That Passed\noff In Quiet Moments, released December 4th, 2020\n\nThe track starts with this melodic arpeggiation that directly feeds into lovely, serene doubled vocals, with some extremely cool layering.\nI won't lie, though — the thing that keeps me coming back to this song over and over is that incredibly catchy, haunting chorus.  The growled-out call and response of the vocals grabs my attention — it's fascinating that something that, stripped of its melodic surroundings, would be a literal shout, blends so well into such a peaceful, floating track.\nIt's fun the way the verse and chorus mirror each other, eventually coming together in a spectacular refrain. That these contradictions are able to blend and flow together make this song absolutely perfect, and I'm sure around a decade from now, this song will sound exactly like how 2020 will sound to me.\nDisheveled Cuss — Oh My God\noff Disheveled Cuss, released June 12th, 2020\n\nTera Melos's Nick Reinhart has struck gold with this track, off of the eponymous Disheveled Cuss.  This track is uniquely situated compared to the rest of the album, and clearly stands out as a single.  There's an element of pop while still having its own sort of experimentation.  That driving backbeat contrasts so well with the fun chorus effects that warp the vocals like a funhouse mirror.\nMoor Jewelry — True Opera\noff True Opera, released April 20th, 2020\n\nMoor Mother and Mental Jewelry's collaborative record is a righteous, fuzzy punk; the whole thing is worth a loud listen.  The title track, however, really stand out for me —&nbsp;it's like an anthem, belting out a hard-hitting punk, punching up the energy and the volume in a really cool way.\nRUBUR — 凯洛斯 Part II\noff 珀耳塞福涅的四季, released September 8, 2020\n\n\"珀耳塞福涅的四季\" (translated, Persephone's Seasons) is a perfect shoegaze record.  It was hard for me to pick one track which stands out, so please let \"凯洛斯 Part II\" (translated, Kairos Part II) serve as your introduction to the album.\nThe vocals dip into a lower range which fits underneath the echoing layering vocals and guitar; the crunchy chorus of guitar drone bounces off of the slightly jangling shuffle from the drums.  It's just so good.  This track, like the rest of the album, sucks you in — it's evocative of a sort of longing that I absolutely love for music to make me feel.\nSipper — Dance In Room Song\noff Pink Songs, released January 21, 2021\n\nI just love this drum machine, the way it layers that triple-hit on top of a quiet, but energetic backline that fits right underneath that driving bass so well.  And how many singers make up this chorus of voices?  The overall effect is of one that's similar to something you've heard before, but with a slight turn to every aspect of the track that grabs your attention.  It's definitely a song to dance in your room to, but there's clearly something deeply sad in the lyrics as well.\nAnd, on top of all of that, there are just these pop elements that make the track stand out — the melodic refrain which starts \"I get high off, high off, feeling half alive\" that fits into the song and therefore that part of my brain that engages with music so well.\nLala Lala &amp; Baths — € € € €^^%%!!!!!heaven!!!!!!\nsingle, released July 24th, 2020\n\nThis track's opening rustlings suggest something slightly aleatoric, an almost happy accident of rhythm and melody which are immediately built upon by digital backing and evocative, repeating vocals.\nThe way the mimetic function of this song is partially nudged through each repetition makes it feel like the background score to something, like a magical walk through a fantasy world that still feels utterly real.\nCaroline Polachek — Breathless\nsingle, released December 17th, 2020\n\n\"Breathless,\" by The Corrs, was released a little over twenty years ago now, and you are a fool if you don't think it is a masterpiece.\nOn the surface, you might see a lot of similarities between this rendition and the original, but from the outset, it becomes pretty clear that Polachek continues to uphold her reputation for powerful vocal performances.  \"Breathless\" was, of course, slightly digital in its own way, with all of the turn-of-the-millennium stylings that a true pop hit from the year 2000 would necessitate.  Caroline Polachek seems to have said, \"okay, how can I remove the elements of this song that sound like the way pop music used to sound like and make it my own?\"\nAfter going back and listening to the original, clearly Polachek's project has worked.  I love this version:  it's a good song just on its own, with the added benefit of having incredible nostalgia backing it up.\n春ねむり — bang\nsingle, released January 15th, 2020\n\nEven through my very bad understanding of Japanese, I can tell that the lyrical subject matter clearly points to this being a sinister song, reflecting the staccato, minor-key chord progression.  The instrumentation is fun and energetic, almost video-game like — and, of course, we have to talk about the violent use of firearms as an element of the song, which is slightly off-putting to me.\nBut despite any sad times that shine through, it's an energetic, upbeat, often even fun song.  Nemuri's vocals clearly stand out; they're astonishingly well acted — there's a line that she half-sings with a slight giggle, 「映えない愛でうたってやるよ」, and it's just perfect.\nLealani — Miniscule\noff Fantastic Planet, released January 18th, 2019\n\n(Note:  this seems to be a remaster after Lealani broke with the original label which released the record, so the release date of this album is a little unclear to me.)\nYou can seriously see the edges on the soundwaves that blast out of this track.  Lelani's unique vocal performance plays the perfect foil to the buzzing, smashing leads and percussion programming.  There's clearly a desire to create something slightly alien here, and it makes for an incredibly fun, pop hit, even between instrumentation choices that might, on the surface, feel casually unapproachable.\nThe lyric content is just as lovely as the rest of the soundscape that surrounds it, juggling with concepts of identity in such a small number of lines.\nAiming for Enrike — Don't Hassle The Hoff\noff of Music For Working Out, released January 10th, 2020\n\nIt's astonishing that so much sound comes out of these two folks playing live.  \"Don't Hassle The Hoff,\" in particular, is like something from a video game.  It really is a great track for working out, but I have often found myself listening to it while working, and it's perfect for that.\nThose guitar tones are so crisp, and though I know there's some clever looping going on, there's enough deviation between each take that the track doesn't sound muddled.  The percussion is technical and fun, and it really drives the tone of each song.\nWhat you don't get out of just listening to this one song is how well it seamlessly blends into the next one, like the rest of the album.  It really is a sonic experience from start to end, and I highly recommend listening to it if you want to feel like you're gaining XP with each email you send.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202101-best/","title":"New Music:  January 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202102-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nIt's the end of the second month of February, and somehow this collection of tracks this month seems, to me, like the appropriate end to winter and a shining beacon pointing toward enjoying some warmer weather.  I hope you enjoy it!\nPom Poko — Andrew\nOff Cheater, released January 15, 2021\n\nI mentioned Pom Poko all the way back in November for the release of their single \"Like A Lady\" — and the album it supports, Cheater, is phenomenal.  To those familiar with the album, it might seem a bit surprising that \"Andrew\" has stood out as my favorite track, but there's just so much happening here that I keep finding myself coming back to it.\nPom Poko's instrumentation is impossible to adequately describe.  It can be, in some moments, a cacophony which all points in the same direction, while at other times all snapping together to sing as one voice.  \"Andrew\" is the epitome of that style — it's jazzy without being jazz, it's like a future genre that will surely be influential upon some genre that doesn't quite exist yet.\nThe real star of the show here, though, is this chorus.  It is perfect.  Jamtveit's vocals follow a guitar line in both pitch and emphasis, and it's an otherworldly effect; especially in the later repetitions, where her call of \"Andrew\" perfectly emulates a wammy bar easing down.  Seriously, it's one of the most impressive vocal takes I've ever heard, and it's just kind of buried as a one-off later in the song.\nThe Lounge Society — Cain's Heresy\nsingle, released February 18, 2021\n\n\"Cain's Heresy\" is a rocking track, but there's a kind of laid-back, chill vibe to its fast-paced rock.  The not-quite shouting moments that the vocals can build up to are the perfect counterpoint to the guitars bouncing around, and the sudden shift most of the way through the song checks off the box to place us firmly into the realm of cool.\nThese kids are going places.  And yes, I'm sure they get it a lot, but this group is super young, so it's incredible for this to be their first effort.\n錯乱前戦 — TAXIMAN\nOff I am SAKURAN-ZENSEN, released March 4, 2020\n\nThis relatively recent track is a fun garage jam:  the guitars go fast and hard, and the vocal performance is the essence of rock.  There's a combination of shouts and claps which pair with a sort of dueling guitar performance; the space of the ripping, rocking vocals makes so much sense in the mix with shredding guitars flanking it.\nThat 「ぶっ壊せ、ペットショップ」 refrain in the chorus is just so great.  This song just screams \"fun,\" and they're obviously having fun with it!\n\n\nFilm School — Is This a Hotel?\nsingle, released February 7, 2020\n\nThis track isn't quite shoegaze, but it's close.  There's a delightful, electronic bass throughout the track which pairs well with the rolling drums, echoy vocals, and even echoier guitars.  The evolution of the track is powerful, dropping in and out in all the right times to create an energetic feeling.  It's honestly just a beautiful tune.\nBessie Turner — Donkey\nsingle, released February 14, 2020\n\nWow, those vocals.\n\"Donkey\" is such a heart-wrenching track.  It's energetic, with guitars pushing us forward and providing more voice to the melody of the chorus.\nAnd that guitar motif is just so cool; it's a great piece to turn the song around, both in the melody and the tone of it.  This song is one that's meant to be played loud — it's deceptively rocking.\nSoko — Looking For Love\nOff Feel Feelings, released July 10, 2020\n\nThe spacey guitars and other instrumentation fit so well with Soko's vocal performance:  in the verse, quiet and gravely, but reverbed and almost belted in the chorus.  Each section is its own part of a bigger cosmic whole in this track.  The mixing is incredible, making a flowing sound out of some more bouncy chord structures.\nELIO — @elio.irl\nsingle, released January 22, 2021\n\nThis poppy, passionate track grips me every time.  It's a lovely song to usher in the spring, with a dream-like quality to it, especially in the vocals.  It's a song that you expect to play in the background of a film, with a soft frame to set up a chance encounter, but there's still this incredible funky bassline underneath the rest of the tones keeping it somewhere upbeat.\nLiza Anne — Bad Vacation\nOff Bad Vacation, released July 24, 2020\n\n\"Bad Vacation\" is a bit of a pop bop with clever subject matter.  Though there's many elements that are ultimately predictable, those elements lay the foundation upon which really clever motifs can shine through.  There's such great guitar tones throughout this track which layer in just the right ways — they're fuzzy, but they sound extremely clean in the soundscape sitting right next to Anne's vocals.  The awesome chorus-shout-guitar-scream in the chorus is fantastic as well.\nBut really, it's not just the instrumentation that's clever — \"you were like sand in my ice cream\" is just such a great lyric.\nKeep Shelly In Athens (feat. Georgia Hurd) — You\nsingle, released February 5, 2021\n\nDang this one's a ripper.  That square-shaped bass line, those drips and claps pair so well with the powerful vocal performance from Georgia Hurd.  There's a kind of 80s vibe to this one, or maybe even early nineties — it's a track that would blare in the background as cars race down a curving mountainside well into the night.\nThe pulsing, driving energy carries throughout the song, but there's enough variation between the verse and the chorus to keep the pace up.  This one definitely belongs on your driving playlist at the very least.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202102-best/","title":"New Music:  February 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202103-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nHello!  Here's some more music.  I hope you enjoy it!\nKynsy — Happiness Isn't a Fixed State\nsingle, released October 2, 2020\n\n\"Happiness Isn't a Fixed State\" is clearly inspired by The Strokes in every aspect, from the guitar tones, structure of the track, even to Kysny's vocals.  But this is clearly an upgrade, in my mind — her vocal performance, especially, is off-the-charts.  There's so much to love here, like the incredible bass tone, and the rocking guitar lines.\nHey Colossus — Donkey Jaw\nOff Dances / Curses, released November 6, 2020\n\nThis song is such a ripper.  Every time it comes on, I end up turning up the volume.  There's a very slightly prog-rock guitar jam going on throughout this entire track, but the thing that really shines the most for me is that astonishing chorus.\nWhy Bonnie — No Caves\nsingle, released April 10, 2020\n\n\"No Caves\" is a sad song with rocking, slightly-jangly guitars.  Blair Howerton's vocals really shine here, the centerpiece of a clever and sweet song.\nBiig Piig — Feels Right\nsingle, released November 17, 2020\n\nAny TV show that would use this song as the title track would be the coolest TV show to ever exist.\nThis song does everything right:  the cool transitions in instrumentation, sometimes even dropping out completely to highlight Jess Smyth's vocals; the super funky bass line; the evolution of the refrain over the course of the track.\nOh, and what a great band name.\nWild Nothing — Foyer\nsingle, released January 1, 2020\n\nI feel like I was a little late to the party with this track, but it's good to see that Wild Nothing is still putting out the hits.  \"Foyer\" is something a bit familiar, with that well-known oceanside, synthy feel, but this track is still unique and will stand out in the catalog as being from this certain era of time.\nThe chord shifts here are the thing that tends to grab my ear, sometimes shifting slightly outside the key without being too distracting.  There's a lot going on in the room that this track creates, with vocals ping-ponging off the ceiling, which somehow makes even more room for creative decisions in the synth tracks.\nJane Weaver — Stages Of Phases\nOff Flock, released March 5, 2021\n\nThis song has an amazing energy and a really delightful fuzziness.  Weaver's vocals are perfect, bouncing on top of a driving, ultra-condensed and distorted rhythm section.\nI haven't spent any time with the album that this track supports yet, but I hope to soon!\nBeautify Junkyards — Reverie\nOff Cosmorama, released January 15, 2021\n\n\"Reverie\" is a beautiful, soft composition.  I love the subtle shifts between the percussive elements, and the space that the woodwind-like samples create around the other elements on the track.  There's a skillful reverb embedded in each piece here, and it makes for a really cool effect.\nGreg Puciato — A Pair of Questions\nOff Child Soldier: Creator of God, released October 9, 2020\n\nMan, this song has a great vibe —&nbsp;from those punchy snare punches which bounce across every other instrument, to the chorus which whispers at you while it feels like it's belting.  It's a fun, kind-of eighties feel; with nice beeps and boops and cool transitions.\nNight Tapes — Download Spirit\nsingle, released November 27, 2020\n\n\"Download Spirit\" is a phenomenal EP, with each track clearly standing on its own.  \"Truly Being Alive\" is a driving electronic thing, and \"Fever Dream Kids\" is a beautiful serenade.  The track that stands out the most for me, though, is the one which lends its title to the EP.\nI really enjoy the almost vaporwave vibes to the instrumentation, and the chorus has a surprisingly catch refrain.\nBullion — We Had A Good Time\nsingle, released February 20, 2020\n\nI could not tell you why this song tugs at my heartstrings so much.  There's almost a Phil Collins atmosphere in this track, and it accomplishes what I can only guess it's trying to accomplish, which is to make me feel some sort of sadness.\nSo many things about this song are clever — from the trading percussion of plucked strings and hand claps mixed right into the forefront of the track, to the delightful thunder sound effect followed by the lyric \"strikes once.\"\nMen I Trust — Tides\nsingle, released February 12, 2021\n\nThe spacey vibes here make this track a fun slow dance — it's incredibly cinematic.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202103-best/","title":"New Music:  March 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202104-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist.

I hope you're having a good time.  Here's a little time capsule of new (to me) music this month.\nshame — Human, for a Minute\nOff Drunk Tank Pink, released January 15, 2021\n\nshame's Drunk Tank Pink is an immense, spectacular record, but \"Human, for a Minute\" really stands out to me.  It's an incredibly dynamic track, with shifting, emotional tones.  The ever-present bass lays the foundation for some excellent vocal takes, and a landscape of guitars add to other ethereal layering to round out the song.\nDeath Of Heather — Living Slow Disaster\nOff Death of Heather, released November 14, 2020\n\nDeath of Heather's self-titled record has a very Slowdive feel to it; it's a perfect, spacey shoegaze, but it still brings something new and delightful to the genre.  The whole record stands together as a cohesive work, but \"Living Slow Disaster\" stands out to me as my favorite track.\nTourists — Align\nOff Another State, released November 20, 2020\n\n\"Align\" is a mysterious and punchy track, with radical guitars and a booming vocal performance.  Every part of this song just bleeds a cool atmosphere, especially the way the verse and the chorus interplay.  And I can't avoid mentioning the incredible layered synth that spikes in the chorus but flows through the latter verses, cradling the song into an incredibly energetic space.\nKiwi jr. — Undecided Voters\nOff Cooler Returns, released January 22, 2021\n\nIt feels like I just wrote about Kiwi jr., which I suppose makes sense, because I wrote about them exactly a year ago, and time doesn't make sense anymore.\nKiwi jr. are back with another rip-rolling record, and I'd be very happy if they continue this one-album-a-year trend!\n\"Undecided Voters\" seems to me to be the most energetic track off this album, though it's certainly elbowing with others on the album to see which will come across as the most fun and the most catchy.\nThis chorus, especially, is belt-worthy:  it's so catchy.  It's seeming more and more clear to me that Kiwi jr. have their formula for churning out the hits, and it's clearly working for them.\nTrace Mountains — Lost in the Country\nOff Lost in the Country, released April 10, 2020\n\nI cannot put my finger on what this Trace Mountains track reminds me of.  It kind of feels like what you'd get if you mixed Emperor X with … I don't know, Pinegrove?\nAnyway, I'm not doing this song justice.  It's a sad one, slightly jangly, with cool guitars and engaging lyrics.\nSarah Chernoff — Remains of the Way\noff Transitions, released April 2, 2021\n\nI had had the release of Sarah Chernoff's new record marked on my calendar for a long time, and I was literally counting down the days.  Do You Feel OK? by Superhumanoids is one of my top-five favorite albums of all time — and, while I write this, it's the album with the highest number of scrobbles on my last.fm account!  I'm immensely saddened that the project seems to be permanently sidelined.\nTransitions is more of a collection of ballads.  You can hear a bit of Chernoff's time with electronic music in the instrumentation of most of the tracks — particularly this one — but the only carry-over, really, is Chernoff's vocals.\nThis is an extremely good song, with just the right notes to give off a tragic, cinematic vibe.  I almost feel like I wasn't fair to the record, because I expected more Superhumanoids, and this is something completely different.\nMoontype — About You\nOff Bodies of Water, released April 2, 2021\n\nMan, this is a fantastic record.  \"About You\" is so good; every piece just works together so well.  It just goes so fast, and every time I think the next part couldn't bring more energy, they find a way.\nIt's just such a smart song, but it doesn't come across sounding as difficult as it must have been to put together.  The perfectly catchy vocals, flawlessly delivered by McCarthy, mirror the guitar, bass, and drums in delightful ways all over the place.  Even when this song's on in the background, I feel like I'm in front of a cork board, drawing lines in my head between each moment.  It seriously gives me chills.\nDon't miss this album — I recommend you check out the slightly slower \"Ferry\" next.\nKaty Kirby — Traffic!\nOff Cool Dry Place, released February 19, 2021\n\nThis is a sweet, lovely song.  Effects which shift in and out over Kirby's voice are a perfect foil to the way the track shifts in and out of moments of driving energy.  It's like every note or percussive element is a pin in the tumbler of the song, with space specially crafted for it, but Kirby's vocals are clearly the key that lines it all up.  There's a whole lot going on here, and I think that's what makes its atmosphere both dramatic and super catchy.\nThat part where everything drops out and we get an organ and a choir is clearly slightly at odds with some guitars which are shredding all on their lonesome, but it's all tied together in such a great way.\nLake Turner — Videosphere\nOff Videosphere, released October 23, 2020\n\nThis is a really lovely, spacey electronic track.  It's incredibly ambient, and went straight onto my \"electronic music to work to\" playlist as soon as I heard it.  If you let the song grip you, you'll find a heart-wrenching atmosphere.\nJordana — Reason\nOff Something to Say to You, released December 4, 2020\n\nThat drum and bass section is so good —&nbsp;I need to be careful that it doesn't blow out my speakers.\nJordana's soft, gentle vocals are fantastic, and it's the perfect foil to that loud, powerful drum loop.  \"Reason\" is almost James Blake-like in its combination of soft vocals and sampling which borrows from a more electronic or hip hop style, but this track is almost danceable, even with Jordana practically whispering at you.\nMette — Petrified\nsingle, released March 3, 2021\n\n\"Petrified\" is a lovely electronic song, with incredible vocal effects and outrageous mixing.  It deserves to be played loud.  Mette's vocals are beautiful, and they are intertwined with the rest of the track like one of the instruments.\nEXUM — Bad Chick Bad Dude\nsingle, released March 25, 2021\n\nI watched the two music videos which EXUM has released so far and realized that he's very likely going to end up being the king of pop.  This is to say that he is clearly on track to become immensely popular, and you should become a fan now, while his catalog is, at time of writing, essentially two songs.\nAnd both songs are fantastic.  I feature the Death Grips-esque hip hop earworm \"Bad Chick Bad Dude\" here, but \"Dark Kept Secret\" is clearly also extremely good, though it slots into an entirely different genre.\n\"Bad Chick Bad Dude\" is clever and catchy.  Every verse has a sort of delightful character behind it, but the chorus really stands out to me as super well-crafted and one of the most repeatable hooks I've ever heard.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202104-best/","title":"New Music:  April 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202105-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nWow, this month absolutely flew by.  Time flies when you're having fun, right?  And I guess this playlist did end up being kind of more fun than usual — it's an energetic lot this time around.  I hope you enjoy it as we kick summer into gear!\nLUMP, Laura Marling, Mike Lindsay — Animal\nsingle, released May 5, 2021\n\n\"Animal\" is such a cool track.  There's so much to talk about here.  The percussive elements of a scratching layered soundscape mesh so well with the shuffling, novel backbeat.  It's almost aleatoric, and it creates this frame for a simple and utterly cool synth to set the stage for Marling's vocals.  The harmonies are utterly entrancing, and they completely suck you in.\nEvery time I listen to this song I find something else to love.  I really hope these folks work together more in the future, because I could easily see an album with this track on it becoming one of my favorites of all time.\nAidan Noell — Prepositional Phrase\nsingle, released February 1, 2021\n\nNation of Language member Noell brings her unique styling to this track, shining through with those typical 80s tones, but adding a unique vocal distortion to her airy vocals.  Prepositional Phrase repeats the same motif several times, but it never comes across as repetitive or overworked; it's just a straight-forward jam.\nGraveyard Club — Valens\nsingle, released April 16, 2020\n\nFans of this article may recognize a lot of motifs in this song that I'm a sucker for:  singing pad lines which cry out over the track, cool guitar takes, vocals which roll in and out between the instrumentation coming back together again, and songs that sound like they're from the eighties.\nSo, yeah, obviously this song is a jam.\nThere's a lot of novel stuff here:  there's a really cool megaphone-like layering effect on the vocals which comes in and out in the verse, there's a bass waveform which wordlessly fills out the lower end of the track to give it that extra oomph.  You can tell a lot of care went into this one, and it's so much better for it.\nBillie Marten — Human Replacement\nOff Flora Fauna, released May 21, 2021\n\n\"Human Replacement\" is like, completely on the edge of pop, any you know that from the beginning with that incredibly cool bass tone.  Marten's vocals are incredible, and everything about this song, from the percussive piano and dramatic string emphasis in the chorus, to the way the track dynamically drops out to an extremely clean space then comes back into a rushing river where you can't actually tell where Marten's vocals stop and the rest of the track begins, all just put the ribbon on calling this one \"cool.\"\nHighSchool — De Facto\nsingle, released February 26, 2021\n\n\"De Facto\" is a fun, noisy track, with really cool guitars, and vocals that sit in a really interesting space, often played like an instrument for their inability to be understood.  The second guitar solo is so great, with a surprisingly few effects manipulating the tone.\nPale Honey — Set Me Free\nOff Some Time, Alone, released November 6, 2020\n\nMy favorite way that tracks make it onto this list when I listen to an album as it moves through The Album Gauntlet, putting tracks from it onto my playlist for the month when they stand out to me.  Typically, what will happen is that the third or fourth time through an album, I'll say to myself something along the lines of \"wow, this song is really great,\" and then I'll think about it for a bit, and that'll become the basis for its entry in this article.\nI put five songs off this record onto my May playlist. And somehow I ended up picking a song off this album that I didn't add to my playlist this year, just because I thought it fit the best into this playlist.\n\"Set Me Free\" is an energetic, awesome track; it bops in and out, it has a really fun, driving guitar line which plays a perfect counterpoint to the bouncing synth bass.  Lodmark's vocals are emphatic and cool, the final piece of the puzzle to this fantastic song on a fantastic album.\nMannequin Pussy — Control\nsingle, released March 23, 2021\n\nPhilly's own Mannequin Pussy are back with another immensely heart-wrenching track.  It's energetic and powerful, but there's something about Missy's vocals that really tug at the heart-strings.  It's not quite emo, but there's a cool guitar layer which screams through the song and really puts the cap on a song that's good at being sad.\nLil Agony — Grief\nsingle, released October 25, 2020\n\nI love any song that I can put on my \"future folk\" playlist.  \"Grief\" is a short track, with a straight-forward message and a straight-forward emotional package, but there's something wonderful about the combination of a heavily-chorused guitar and a slowly building synth bass track.\nIguana Death Cult — Meat Market\nsingle, released May 26, 2021\n\nIf you like IDLES, you probably already know about Iguana Death Cult.  \"Meat Market\" is hot off the presses, and it's an extremely fun, punky, chanted track; it has something utterly \"lad\"-like, and I really like how it makes no excuses for wanting to rock and roll.\nBlanketman — Leave The South\nsingle, released January 19, 2021\n\nI really love this song a lot, not just because it deeply resonates with me, someone who is extremely conflicted about having left the south (of the United States) and identifies strongly with the lyrics.  (It goes without saying that I'm not trying to say any location or any person is better than anyone else.)\nThe Blanketman track has an almost They Might Be Giants vibe to it, a poppy, lovely picture surrounding witty lyrics which drive the song further and further into your skull.  It's happy and fun, but it's also a track I have to be in the right mindset for, lest I start overthinking my own migration.\nThe Natvral — Why Don't You Come Out Anymore?\nOff Tethers, released April 2, 2021\n\n\"Why Don't You Come Out Anymore?\" follows a tradition that I absolutely love; a rocking coif of a track which just exudes cool.\nSo much of this track just rings out, especially when you play it loud; there's layering that only serves to add a jacket to the root of the song that just as well would deliver the same punch if it were just one person and one guitar.  It almost sounds analog when songs come together like this, and The Natvral have put forth a really great effort to further the genre.\nCheekface — We Need a Bigger Dumpster\nsingle, released April 26, 2021\n\nCheekface are back with their witty, cute lyrics which point to something slightly more sinister.  You can't write about their work without comparing it to their unimpeachable \"Dry Heat/Nice Town,\" but \"We Need a Bigger Dumpster\" is an excellent follow-up for this new era we find ourselves in.\nI love the catchy vocal hooks, the bright and brilliant instrumentation, and those well-rounded percussion elements.  The lyrics are a great reminder:  you know, everything is fine.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202105-best/","title":"New Music:  May 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202106-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nAnd, just like that, we're halfway through the year!  I hope you enjoy these new tunes.\nBachelor, Jay Som, and Palehound — Stay in the Car\nOff Doomin' Sun, released May 28, 2021\n\nDoomin' Sun is a spectacular feat of a record, but truly the standout track for me is \"Stay in the Car,\" a poppy but rocking hit.\nI love everything about this track, from the gravely vocal harmonies playing through the verse and chorus to the spectacular guitar tones which kick into higher and higher gear as the track progresses.\nIn the beginning of the song, there's this really fun crackling noise like a guitar's being plugged in, and I'm glad they put in that little detail; I also really think the ways that the track switches between energies, even breaking down to a more acoustic verse, works to make the song as dynamic as possible.\nI really do think \"Stay in the Car\" will end up being one of my favorite tracks from this year, but even if it wasn't on this record, \"Anything at All\" would also be a massive triumph —&nbsp;definitely check that one out next.  Then listen to \"Spin Out.\"  Just listen to the record!\nTriángulo de Amor Bizarro — Vigilantes del Espejo\nOff Triángulo de Amor Bizarro, released March 20, 2020\n\nThis isn't exactly the newest song, but it's new to me, and I couldn't leave it off the list.\nThis is a passionate, straight-forward rock/pop track, something cinematic and danceworthy.  I absolutely adore that \"una noche más\" refrain, delivered with such a convincing, passionate vocal performance.  There's almost something The Cure-like with the way the guitars play off the synth, making a really fun, poppy package.\nThe Wytches — Fly Inside\nOff Three Mile Ditch, released November 13, 2020\n\nSometimes constraints are what it takes to unlock the creative process, and this 6/6 to 5/6 shuffle that plays through the verse clearly sets The Wytches up to let their guitars take off.\nKristian Bell's vocals are an excellent piece of tone building, making something that's garage-ready, but slightly spooky.  This track is really energetic for something that's a little more downtempo.\nMelenas — 3 segundos\nOff Dias Raros, released May 8, 2020\n\nThis Melenas album is a great collection of tunes, but my favorite is the more single-worthy \"3 segundos,\" with its swirling filters on the guitars, to a very poppy and clever vocal refrain.\nAllie Crow Buckley — Nothing Sacred\nOff Moonlit and Devious, released March 12, 2021\n\n\"Nothing Sacred\" almost points to \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\" a driven slow-jam with some very cool vocal lines that stick in your head.  And I couldn't not mention Buckley's exceptional vocal styling, with rich and full tones that are almost the opposite of the piercing, distorted guitar tones which play against her.\nMadeline Kenney — Summer Quarter\nsingle, released January 22, 2021\n\n\"Summer Quarter\" is a soft and sweet track from Madeline Kenney's EP of the same name.  This is a very smart song, where every piece knows exactly what it's doing.  I love the Phil Collins vibe, with spacey guitars and vocals wrapped around ethereal layering.\nAbout halfway through, the track kicks up the gear, getting a bit more driven, with emotion pouring from every turn.  The non-traditional song structure really comes together, a whole atmospheric package that you shouldn't miss.\n缺省 — Can You Hear the Whistle Blow\nsingle, released August 12, 2020\n\nI love this catchy, soft, technical track from 缺省.  The composition is seriously impressive, but not in a way that detracts from the performance; even as the track builds, you don't lose sight of the cool, contorting guitar composition, and powerful chords built with soft harmonies and violin-like synth pads.\nOeil — Perfect\nsingle, released January 13, 2021\n\nOeil is back, and their most recent single, \"Perfect,\" is, well, perfect!\nI love this kind of spacey not-quite-shoegaze, a spectacular roundabout of swirling tones and energy.\nThe organ refrain is a fun foundation for this track, with the modulated vocals rising and falling against the shifting volumes and space.\nThis song really seems like the evolution of some sort of tradition, to be played in the triumphant or romantic moments of some film, with a perfect ending to complete the set.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202106-best/","title":"New Music:  June 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202107-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nWelcome back!\nThere's a bit of a different mix of songs this time around — there's a few more slower ballads than normal, but I'm glad that this playlist ended up with your usual spread of electronic, danceable beats and energetic, thrashing guitars, too.  I hope you enjoy it!\nWombo — Dreamsickle\nsingle, released March 30, 2021\n\nThis song absolutely rips.  I love the contrast between Sydney Chadwick's carefully crafted, low vocals, and the energetic, ripping three-piece drum, guitar, and bass combo — the latter of which Chadwick plays.\nThis band is right up my alley, and I want to spend more time with their existing record catalog soon.  I also love their website, which does a fantastic job of revealing how close their live sound is to the recording, too.\nThe Notwist feat. Saya — Ship\nOff Vertigo Days, released January 29, 2021\n\nLongtime psychrockers The Notwist are back with a fantastic record, Vertigo Days, and it was really hard for me to pick just one track off of it.\n\"Ship\" just has a great groove to it, but the cherry on top are Saya's Japanese-language vocals, and to echo the lyrics:  yeah, it's good.\nAnother highlight is that pulsing baseline, bouncing in and around the psychedelic tones.  Listen to \"Al Sur\" next!\nWednesday — One More Last One\nsingle, released July 7, 2021\n\nI wrote about Wednesday back in May 2020, and it's really great to see that they're releasing more singles after their fantastic record Fate Is….\nWednesday have taken a huge turn to shoegaze this time, and I love it —&nbsp;this is a powerful wall of sound, and it's a great part of this soundtrack to life.  One word I feel like I reach for a lot is \"cinematic,\" but that's absolutely the case here —&nbsp;it's a song you want to hear when there's a camera running somewhere and you're in the background of the shot.\nMetz — Acid\nsingle, released March 12, 2021\n\nWell, right from the outset, with those screeching guitars, you know what you're in for!  This song is an energetic punk piece, with the utterly cool, distorted vocals from Alex Edkins blending with an impressive back line.  Like, this is what punk is all about:  there's a kind of message with the lyrics which are admittedly hard to understand, punctuated by the way the rest of the instrumentation builds up and drops out.  And, of course, there's an unmistakable energy; this would be a great track to run really fast to.\nGeese — Disco\nsingle, released June 22, 2021\n\nThis is a straight-forward jam from Geese, a rock song with a cool vocal style and a few moments where the energy builds and drops out.  There's a bit of a prog element in how a few separate movements come together here, ultimately telling a cool story with the progression of the chords and lyrics.\nI'm excited to hear more from these folks; this is seemingly, at time of writing, the only track they've put out, though they seem to be playing shows, so surely there's more to come soon!\nShamir — On My Own\nOff Shamir, released October 2, 2020\n\nShamir is the quintessential songwriter, and On My Own is the ultimate pop song with serious indie credentials.  The parts which come together in this track are astonishing — the thing that stands out the most is the ever-moving, fuzzy bass line, but it seems like every listen I find something cool and technical.\nShamir's vocals are also incredible, fitting the earworm of a melody very well.\nSurely this one ended up coming across my plate because of The Algorithm — I really ought to spend more time with the rest of his discography!\nPublic Service Broadcasting feat. EERA — People, Let's Dance\nsingle, released June 1, 2021\n\nPublic Service Broadcasting are back with their first single in … not a short amount of time, at least — something around three years.  This new track does exactly what's on the label:  it's an energetic, cool, dance track with fun guitar licks.\nBrodka and Scottibrains — Wrong Party\nsingle, released January 22, 2021\n\n\"Wrong Party\" is a delightful… actually, I don't really know how to classify it, to be honest.  It kind of feels like a dance track, but there's not a lot of the traditional electronic influences that you'd typically expect.  Brodka's vocal performance is extremely cool, and the beeps and boops that Scottibrains brings to the table round out the track to be something caught between a kind of gothic tone and a happy, poppy thing.\nI really like that chorus; it repeats itself in a good way, and it's definitely the centerpiece that the rest of the track revolves around.\nKatie Dey and Lonelyspeck — Darkness (Lonelyspeck remix)\nOff Urdata, released January 29, 2021\n\nI wrote about Katie Dey's Mydata nine months ago, and back then, I had a hard time picking just one song off of the record.  There's a bit of an unconventional mixing style there, which kind of encourages you to play the tracks loud, especially \"Dancer,\" the track I ultimately ended up going with.  Lonelyspeck took an incredible song and just translated it into something otherworldly, leaving behind a flowing digital experience.\nFalle Nioke and sir Was — Wonama yo ema\nsingle, released April 14, 2021\n\nThis track is perfect.\nIt's cinematic, and it's an atmosphere that grips me every time.  Every piece of this song is in the right place: Nioke's expressive, perfect vocal take is an astonishing centerpiece which are wrapped by the Gongoma tones and sir Was's production and percussion.\nI don't understand the Susu-language lyrics, but this song absolutely envelops me with emotion; from what I've found online, the message behind the song is as powerful as the track itself, too.\nBubble Tea and Cigarettes — Santa Monica\nsingle, released May 14, 2021\n\nI love this slow jam from newcomers Bubble Tea and Cigarettes; it's a sweet, long, emotional track that knows how to take its time.  There's some really cool strings that support the kind of traditional ballad four-piece instrumentation, and some subtle overtone tricks with the percussion and pads in the background, but that all pales in comparison to the magnificent octave-split vocals.\nLet's hope there's more to come from this duo!\nSaint Saviour and Bill Ryder-Jones — Home\nOff Tomorrow Again, released September 4, 2020\n\nI love Saint Saviour's vocals in this sweet and gripping track.  The unique instrumentation has a sort of aleatoric feel, making the analog tracks feel somehow immensely digital.\nI love how everything builds over time in this song, with Ryder-Jones's vocals providing the perfect foil to the amazing doubled harmonies from Saint Saviour.\nAlso, this chorus is just amazing; there's a slight trick with the melody in the lyric \"Breathe the morning in / Fisher King calls out\" that I can't quite pin down, but it catches my ear every time.\nLucinda Chua — Until I Fall\nsingle, released April 20, 2021\n\nThis orchestral, percussion-free track from Lucinda Chua packs a big punch with all of the space it leaves on the table.  Chua's vocals are always the most prominent, with the rest of the instrumentation following her like the orchestra below the stage.\nChua's rich, airy vocal timbre is clearly an instrument in itself, and there's a great parallel with some more reverbed, distorted, electronic instruments that provide that extra layering kick.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202107-best/","title":"New Music:  July 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202108-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nHi!  I'm really excited about this month's playlist —&nbsp;there's a lot of good music here.  A some of the tracks here are pulled from a playlist created by a local store, Omoi Zakka Shop, so big thanks to them for putting together a great collection of tunes!\nQuivers — You're Not Always On My Mind\nOff Golden Doubt, released June 11, 2021\n\n\"You're Not Always On My Mind\" is a concise ditty of a track which reminds me of the best kinds of proto-indie pop rock from the nineties.  Clever, catchy vocal hooks, combining with some brilliant, spacey guitar layering; some subtle ringing tones filling out the layering in the back of the track, and plenty of space left for the song to take off where it wants to go.  I love this kind of extended four-piece feel, and this track is the epitome of what the genre can be.\nAlice Phoebe Lou — Glow\nOff Glow, released March 19, 2021\n\nThis song almost reminds me of Unknown Mortal Orchestra, with a very tight, snappy, pared down instrumentation distorted and overdriven, only to be covered over by a certain vocal style.  Alice Phoebe Lou's vocals are impeccable — I love how each line in the song has an explicit purpose, and there inflection she employs while rolling through the song is perfect every time.  Some of the takes which somehow hide in the mix of the double-tracked vocals are so immensely clever that you can't help but be hooked.\nOpposite Sex — Combine Harvester\nOff High Drama, released May 24, 2021\n\nThis song is my newest obsession.  I love the slow ramp up at the beginning, and the dramatic energy that comes with every movement.  It's so effortlessly cool, and it's an atmosphere I wish I deserved to be wrapped in all the time.\nLucy Hunter's double-tracked vocals work so well, but I am particularly enamored with the refrain, which is just perpetually stuck in my head now — every time it manages to get unwedged, I'll listen to one of the many playlists I've already put this track onto and spend the rest of the week singing to myself, \"c-c-c-com-b-bine, com-b-b-bine harvester.\"\nThe Chills — Monolith\nOff Scatterbrain, released May 14, 2021\n\nOkay, let's get this out of the way:  do you like Guided by Voices?  You will love this song for all of the same reasons.\n\"Monolith\" is a swirling, punchy jam; a track that that implores you to go.  There's a lot of energy here, but not in the traditional ways that you might expect from such a bouncy track.  And, of course, that refrain is so incredibly catchy.\nWednesday — Twin Plagues\nOff Twin Plagues, released August 13, 2021\n\nIt's really hard for me to not just stick Wednesday on every single one of these playlists.\n\"Twin Plagues\" is the title track off Wednesday's brand new LP, a sludgy and flowing song that continues that great tone they've put together of not-quite-shoegaze, not-quite-horrorcore rock.\nFOTOS — Das Verlangen\nOff Auf zur Illumination!, released February 26, 2021\n\nI think this German-language track from Das Verlangen is a spectacular poppy piece.  I really like the amplified effects on the vocals, and the magical layering that plays throughout the entire track.  They've really hit something with this chorus — when it's played loud, it's a surprisingly energetic, emphatic piece.\nAli Awan — Moon Mode\nsingle, released April 9, 2021\n\nPhiladelphia-based Ali Awan really made a hit with this one.  I love how every instrument on this track is spacey in its own way; the almost percussive \"moon mode\" declaration in the refrain is the perfect match for this round and driven bass line and the impeccable guitar takes.\nTei Shi — Bassically - Acoustic\nsingle, released February 26, 2021\n\nTei Shi clearly deserves the critical acclaim that she has already earned, but this acoustic take of one of her many perfect tracks just demonstrates her immense range and talent.\nThis song drips with emotion when Tei Shi performs it, but there's something radically different about this slightly slower, severely stripped-down reimagining.\nMr Twin Sister — Expressions\nsingle, released March 19, 2021\n\nMr Twin Sister have been one of the coolest bands to exist since, like, 2008.  It's great to see that they're still putting out this amazing discotheque music, and honestly, I think \"Expressions\" might be my favorite track from them so far.  I just love the way that drum slams its way through the track, perfectly punctuated by one of the best bass lines in the business.  The vocals, of course, are incredible, but to me, they're the capstone on an incredible groove of a track with a legendary chorus.\nSipper — green line\nOff Half Young, released August 6, 2021\n\nSipper has released three albums so far this year, which is extraordinary in and of itself.  But while this one-person act continues to evolve, the format of bouncing keys seems largely the same, which the subject matter and overall tone have basically entirely evolved to something much happier compared to Pink Songs.\n\"green line\" is a slower, but somehow upbeat song, continuing a recent but great tradition of a certain kind of vibe being carefully cultivated by each song in Sipper's discography.\nLike the rest, this song is good at being catchy, but it's substantive, and there's something new to discover with each listen.\nCrumb — Trophy\nOff Ice Melt, released April 30, 2021\n\n\"Trophy\" is well within the \"lo-fi hip-hop beats to study and relax to\" tradition, but there's something much more active about the journey that this track creates, even before the distortion kicks into high gear in the track's bridge.  I think it's something about Lila Ramani's vocals; they're smooth and performed in a cool, relaxed style, but there's high energy keeping this downtempo song immensely driven.\n박혜진 Park Hye Jin &amp; Nosaj Thing — CLOUDS\nsingle, released December 9, 2020\n\nLA-based Park collides with well-loved producer Nosaj Thing in this cool, downtempo, Korean-language track.  This song is basically everything I ever want from electronic music — it has a great feel to it, and each individual part is quite catchy, but taken as a whole, it can be either a soundscape to dive into or something to have on in the background while you work.  The production on this track is fantastic, with the peaks of each loop fitting perfectly into the valleys of the others.\nCold Beat — See You Again\nsingle, released July 7, 2021\n\nCold Beat are stirring the waters again with a few new singles, which I'm incredibly excited about, after the release of their fantastic record Mother last year.\n\"See You Again\" is a sweet, slow song; it's a nice, fluid jam, and I love its ethereal electronic tones.\nL'Rain — Two Face\nOff Fatigue, released June 25, 2021\n\nYou can't escape the shifting polyrhythms of this jazzy, electronic track; the brilliant, expectation destroying arpeggiations somehow lay the bedrock for a stellar jazz vocal performance which flows in and out of rhythmic lines.  It's like every single part has been given permission to march at its own pace, but the skill of the composition of the track somehow keeps it all together in this magnificent melodic track.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202108-best/","title":"New Music:  August 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202109-best/":{"body":"\nHere's a link to the playlist. The play buttons embedded here will play 30-second clips if you're not logged into Spotify in your browser, which is probably the best way to listen to the tracks while reading this article.\nHello!  I've been surprisingly busy lately, but here's some great songs that are new to me this month.\nField Music — No Pressure\nOff Flat White Moon, released April 23, 2021\n\nField Music are so good.\nThat round, fuzzy bass fits so well with the clever vocal chorus and key overlays.  I can't quite put a finger on what this track reminds me of.  Maps &amp; Atlases?  A David Byrne song?  Either way, it's clearly uniquely their own, and it's just so good.\nSquid (with Martha Skye Murphy) — Narrator\nOff Bright Green Field, released May 7, 2021\n\nThis shouty, mathy song is incredibly energetic.  Typically, I'm not a fan of clashing instruments coming together to sort of paint a chord across the soundscape of a track, but Squid take this to the platonic ideal with the dancing guitars supporting the vocal lines.\nAll 508 minutes of this track are doing something; it's not a distracting song, but it's not exactly something you can forget is on in the background, either; for me, it's more of a song to rock out to while I'm getting something done, with really progressive peaks and valleys blending together.\nBilly Nomates — No\nOff Billy Nomates, released August 7, 2020\n\nDon't let the title fool you — this is actually kind of a positive song, but it also oozes cool.  The chorus is incredibly well put together, and the way all of the tracks layer together encourage you to blast this song as loud as you can.\nAmyl and The Sniffers — Guided By Angels\nOff Comfort To Me, released September 10, 2021\n\nYou may find this song to be too punk.  If so, you should get over it, because this song rules.\nI wish I would have heard this song for the first time at some small house show.  Instead, through the magic of the internet, this ripping three-part bop is blaring in my headphones.\nMaybe I'd be a bit scared to go to an Amyl and The Sniffers show.  Maybe that's one of the reasons why I love this song.\nJulia Shapiro — Come With Me\nsingle, released August 10, 2021\n\nI love this soft, sad, serenading song, with its ringing guitars and string-like overtone layering.  The harmonized vocals are fantastic, really setting the capstone on the tone.\nDarwin Deez — The Birthday Song\nsingle, released April 6, 2021\n\nI mean, Darwin Deez definitely does not need the exposure of some random guy's music blog.  This relatively recent song of his plays well in the Deez tradition; a punchy lo-fi instrumentation that makes you want to pick up a guitar, paired with immensely clever, technical, sonorous vocals.\nThe way this whole track comes together is something special, though; it's just a good song.\nBeak&gt; — Ah Yeh - Full Length Version\nsingle, released September 1, 2021\n\nIt's hard to describe this one — it's punchy, with a million different drums playing together, covering over a chord structure I can't quite pick out — but it's also downtempo, with a clever, single, wavering tone hitting the top of each measure, shifting your perspective and making the track feel otherworldly.  It's certainly a fantastic experience.\nA Certain Ratio — Keep it Together\nsingle, released April 6, 2021\n\nDang, that percussion is punchy, all the way down to the claps.\nA Certain Ratio have been around for a long, long time, but they're clearly evolving and continuing to build on the institutional knowledge they've created over the course of their career.  The result is an incredibly hip track, one that you'll almost certainly hear spun by the coolest DJ you know very soon.  It definitely has a very Love Injection vibe.\nIf you like funky, danceable tracks, this one's definitely for you.\nJeff Parker and The New Breed (feat. Ruby Parker) — Soul Love\nsingle, released May 13, 2021\n\nThere's so much going on in this track.  It's a jazzy, no-quite-electronic song; it's a little fast for a ballad, but it definitely feels like a powerful one.  Ruby Parker's vocals have this very slight distortion on them which kicks up a little bit in the chorus, and I think it rounds out the soulful feel of the track so well.  There's even a little bit of improvisational riffing near the end, mostly coming from the guitar, but a little bit on the drums too, and it makes this feel like an actual, real song, not the processed, packaged thing that we've come to know in the internet age.  This track really should be a new standard; it's amazing on its own, but it belongs in your fake book, too.\nKhazali — Better with the Devil\nsingle, released September 15, 2021\n\nI've been on a real Kitsuné kick lately.  This new track from their frequent collaborator Khazali isn't (as far as I know) out from the Kitsuné label, which might explain the more downtempo feel, a bouncing, club-like style that sinks low and feels sad and cool.  The instrumentation is exceptional, matched perfectly by the vocal sylings of Khazali himself.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202109-best/","title":"New Music:  September 2021"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/the-gauntlet/":{"body":"How does music make its way into your life?  How do you decide what to listen to every day?  What if instead of saying, \"ah, I'll just put some music on while I'm working,\" you had an over-designed system created to maximize the number of new artists you can experience and ensure you give enough attention to each one?\nEnter The Gauntlet.\nThe Gauntlet is, on its surface, straight-forward:  it's two playlist folders containing seven playlists:\nThe Gauntlet/\n├── queue/\n│   ├── zero\n│   ├── one\n│   ├── two\n│   ├── three\n│   └── four\n├── done (0)\n└── abandoned\n\nThe Gauntlet is a kanban board for albums.  Whenever you want to listen to a new album — say you find out that a new record has come out, or you want to check out the back catalog of an artist that is rapidly rising in your esteem, or someone simply says \"oh, you should listen to this album\" —&nbsp;you add it to the zero playlist.  Every album that you hear about that you even vaguely might desire listening to goes in the zero playlist.\nAfter that, the rules are simple:\n\nThe zero playlist is your starting point.  Once you listen to an album, it is advanced one playlist.  That is, for example, the first time you listen to an album, it is added to playlist \"one\" and removed from playlist \"zero.\"\nYou may only advance an album to the next stage in The Gauntlet once per day.\nOnce an album is listened to five times — that is, once it would advance from the \"four\" playlist, it goes to the \"done\" playlist.  When this happens, increase the counter on the done playlist's name (\"done (1)\" becomes \"done (2)\").\nIf you well and truly cannot make it through an album, move it to the abandoned playlist.\n\n\"Doesn't the zero playlist get overwhelming?\" I hear you ask.  Yes, it does, but that's okay.  Not all stress is negative stress.  Embrace the zero playlist.  I create a new gauntlet for each year (or at least I'm trying to) — at time of writing, we're a little over halfway through this year and I'm at eighty albums waiting for appreciation in my zero playlist, clocking in at about 58 hours of music.  Am I going to listen to all of this?  Maybe one day!\nYou will notice that music tends to band together as it makes its way across The Gauntlet.  My \"one\" playlist tends to act as a bit of a proving ground, where albums will get sort of grouped together by genre or mood as they can then move down the line.\nDo not abandon albums.  You should consider it a personal defeat if you cannot make it through an album.  That being said, at time of writing, my \"abandoned\" playlist has 85% of the number of songs as my zero playlist, and it'll surely be longer than my zero playlist soon.  That's just how it goes.  Use the \"abandoned\" playlist as a record of records you couldn't appreciate.  Use it sparingly.\nI keep these as Spotify playlists, so it's easy for me to navigate on the go; if an album comes up in conversation, odds are I'll quickly navigate to it on Spotify and drop it into my zero playlist.\nThe history of The Gauntlet\nI started using a version of this system a little over nine years ago now.  One of the first albums to graduate for me is one of my all-time favorite records, \"The Century of Self\" by …And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead.  Just scrolling through this playlist of albums I've listened to mostly a decade ago, I'm filled with such joy — and because of The Gauntlet, they've been firmly wedged in my head.\nI don't really remember why I started doing this — I think it's because I kept finding myself forgetting that artists existed.  I also had just met some great folks on turntable.fm (now defunct), and I wanted to make sure I really appreciated their music recommendations.\n\n    \n    \n        Some of my favorite albums which have graduated from The Gauntlet\n    \n\nWhy five listens?\nI found five times through an album was enough for me to both feel like I'm really familiar with it and for me to form a strong opinion about it.  The first or second time you listen to a song, you might not really appreciate every part of it:  you're still skimming the surface.  But on the fifth time, for me, I start to understand the story that's being told, and I start hearing the little bits of layering in the tracks that might have otherwise gone unnoticed.\nThis is also why I try to give an album five chances to grow on me, unless it's well and truly distracting.  There really are a few albums that I didn't like much on the first listen through, but maybe on the fourth or fifth, one song stood out that I really enjoyed, or maybe I even came around on the whole project.\nI also tend to listen to almost exclusively songs with vocals; the fifth listen is when I start to remember lyrics to songs — especially the ones that I really like.\nThis isn't rooted in any sort of science, though!  This may be different for you; you might want to shorten or even lengthen your gauntlet.  This is just the sweet spot that I found and stuck to.\nIs this right for me?\nOf course not!  You will not be able to just blindly accept this system.  If you want it to stick around, you should make sure it fits somewhere into the workflow that you already have.  If you want to implement your own gauntlet, make sure it's not some life-altering event:  if it's a little habit change, you'll be way more likely to be successful than if it requires a great deal of shifting your schedule around or a lot of work to remember to use it.\nSo, please, morph it into your own and make it fit the workflow you already have.  I would love to hear about how this changes the way you listen to music — feel free to drop me a line at joewoods at fastmail dot com.\nOkay, but why on earth would I do this?\nWhy not?\nI also keep a playlist for songs that stood out to me every month.  This may be older songs that I ended up listening to again for the first time in a while and think, \"oh yeah, this rules,\" or it could be tracks that are new to me that stood out for some reason (probably because I thought they were jams).  The gauntlet makes filling these little time capsules so easy.\nI also write a music article that is completely a side effect of The Gauntlet.  Because I put as many new albums in my \"zero\" playlist as possible, I mostly listen to brand new music, so I write about new songs that stood out to me every month.\nThis system is so firmly wedged into my habits that it essentially costs me nothing, and that I feel as though I'm really appreciating every song I discover for myself makes me truly happy.\nSo why not give it a shot?\nReader comments\nYou can comment on this article by sending a note to joewoods @ fastmail.com.

I admit that this means that I don't necessarily have the best grasp on some concepts that other engineers might consider basic knowledge, but what I lack there I sincerely believe I make up for in tools I've built for myself to be able to research and communicate the best I ever can.\nWe all have systems for how we interact with everything, be they formal and rarely-changing, or informal and amorphous.  One of the most important decisions you make whenever you do anything is whether or not you are going to follow the checklist.  Almost always, this decision is automatic, and you don't even realize that you're making it.  But you have a choice every time.\nUnless you're a pilot or something.  You'll still have a choice as to whether or not to follow the checklist before taking off, but you almost certainly should.\nSo:  how do you build and use a formal set of constraints for taking notes?  For me, this came about from practice — trying things out and seeing if they'd stick, and borrowing ideas from others when I thought they'd make sense for my system.  This document represents the sum of these efforts — the total combination of work that I've done to improve this specific facet of the work that I do both for my career and in my personal life.\nI hope, by showing off the way I organize my research notes, that you can do the same thing:  take what you like, try it out in whatever way you want, use it, or just let it add a few more ideas to the pile that you can draw from later down the road.\nWhy this system\nMost of the time, I will only read something once, and anything that sticks out goes into my notes document, which will then be the thing that I will consult in the future.  Lately, I've almost entirely been applying this system to books that are either directly about or tangentially related to programming, but in grad school, I used this system for articles and for fiction as well.\nIn grad school, I probably turned out about two papers a week.  In life, now, I probably make more flashcards for myself than I really should.\nFor both of these contexts, it's good to have an easy repository of knowledge.  By having everything in one place, in an actionable document, I could, say, write an essay on a text by skimming the points I made to myself, directly quoting from the source just by copying and pasting the quote I had transcribed earlier.  When reading a technical manual or treatise on a subject, it's great to just have one source that I can then pass through and make sure I convert the important things that I want to get from the text into permanent knowledge.\nBut above all else, creativity comes from constraint.  By setting myself up to have a system where close reading requires a computer, where I must read actively and transcribe, I will always be doing my best work when reading.\nUnless I'm reading exclusively for pleasure, then I don't use this system at all.\nOther rules\n\nDon't confuse your page numbers. The book page is the page number that appears typeset on the page itself, the pdf page is the page of the PDF that we're currently on.  For example, you may have a PDF that is a scanned article from the middle of the textbook —&nbsp;you must cite, say, book page number 200 when transcribing a quote, but it's often easier to write down the book page when writing down something that will help you find something in the text at a later time.\nJust write it in markdown.  You should learn markdown —&nbsp;it's everywhere.\nMake it accessible.  You should be able to edit your notes from anywhere, at any time.  Unless you don't have a phone or a computer in front of you, that is, but come on, that's so rare, now-a-days.\nBack up your work.  There's no point in going through all this trouble if you can't come back to your beautiful notes five, twenty, or 100 years from now.  Only keeping one copy of your notes on Google Docs is not a good backup strategy!  In fact, if you go all-in on this system, you may end up with a document with a large number of quote from outside sources that could trip some content filter in the shadows of any proprietary platform you use and cause your notes to suddenly disappear one day without warning or explanation.  So:  back up your notes!\nMake it your own!  Take what I've written here and make it make sense for you; remix it and fit it into your life as much as you want.  Definitely don't take any of this as law.\n\nThe system\nEach document is formatted in the following way:\n\nThe h1 is the title of the book.  Below it goes an MLA citation.  There may also be additional thoughts, TODOs, or other information about the text in the topmost section.\nEach chapter with notes gets its own h2.  (Sub-sections are likewise headed the next heading down.)\nEach independent thought is an item in an unordered list. The first characters of a thought indicate:\n\n.: this is my commentary\npage number: direct quote from the source when wrapped in quotes, paraphrased information that would still require a citation if not.\n\nMust always be the book page number for the sake of citations!\nPage number may be a span of numbers, or roman numerals (or maybe even a span of roman numerals)\nI try to directly quote (wrap in quotation marks) as often as possible, because it means that quoting directly from the source is absurdly easy —&nbsp;I just lift the quote from my notes instead!\n\nThis saved my butt countless times in college, especially.\n\n\n\n\n?: a question I have.  Answers may be indented.\n!: I need to make a flashcard for this.\n!+: I made a flashcard for this.\n!-: I marked that was going to make a flashcard for this, but didn't end up doing so.\n!!! This is really cool.\n\n\nSome tags may be combined.\nThe last non-heading line of a file will almost certainly be a declaration of the place I stopped in a document, i.e. \"stopped on pdf page 56.\"\n\nIt's really important to note here whether or not we're referring to the PDF page or the book page with this number!\n\n\n\nA brief example\n# _Excession_ by Iain M.

Relatively close to the start of my college career, I was looking for ways to continue to engage with the writing habit I had when I was in high school, and was able to use this site for about three months in a row of writing every day.  At the time, I also wrote a journal on pen and paper, but that habit fell away after about a year.  Then, in 2017, I had another three-month streak of writing every day, which transformed itself into a new kind of habit:  just sitting down for somewhere between 15 minutes and half an hour to put down whatever comes to mind.  Then again for five months in 2019 — I was devastated when I forgot a day, waking up in a panic at 2 a.m. to find that my precious streak was gone, so I broke the habit again.\nThen, in 2020, as you all know, the world changed quite a bit, and I looked for any opportunity to create structure in my life that I could find.  This now means that as of April 3rd, 2021, I have written 750 words a day for 365 days straight.  I've sat down every day for somewhere between fifteen minutes and two hours to write down 750 words.  Most of the time, I'll do this in the morning, right after reading my morning articles with breakfast and right before walking the dog.  But that's not always the case —&nbsp;on the weekends, especially, I'll end up doing it later in the day.\nThis habit does mean that I've been writing more.  I've built two spaces to publish text online.  I now have a few recurring articles, and more springing up as time goes on:  I'm extremely proud that I write and publish a little report of what I've done the previous month, every month; and I'm really happy with my little article about music that almost nobody reads, but I'll be glad to look back on as small time capsules of my life.\nIt's these writing moments that lay the foundation for other creative ventures that get expressed in small ways.  Creativity isn't about small bursts of wonder, though those do happen.  The most important thing I've learned is to get an idea and then immediately write it down.  I've been making a bunch of lists of ideas that make me happy:  projects to work on, articles to write, little affirmations to keep in mind.  These ideas grow over time, until they're big enough that acting on them seems like sleepwalking, an effortless thing that just sort of happens to you.\nI have written well over 277,000 words this year.  But that doesn't mean I've published even a tenth of those words.  Instead, I use that space as a tool to plan, to get myself into a positive mindset, to meditate on what I want to work on in the world and about myself, to rant and ramble.\nOne day relatively soon, my morning routine will have to be different again, because I will have to start taking the train into the office again.  But even when it's hard, this habit is worth it — I love that the discipline I pour into this simple thing feels like the foundation for the rest of the things that I like to spend time on.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/other-thoughts/writing-750-words-a-day/","title":"Writing 750 Words a Day"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/":{"body":"","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/","title":"Technology"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/alfred-emoji-modified/":{"body":"👋🏿👋🏾👋🏽👋🏼👋🏻\nTo install, just follow the appropriate link:\n\n🙋🏿 Emoji Pack (Dark Skin Tone)\n🙋🏾 Emoji Pack (Medium-Dark Skin Tone)\n🙋🏽 Emoji Pack (Medium Skin Tone)\n🙋🏼 Emoji Pack (Medium-Light Skin Tone)\n🙋🏻 Emoji Pack (Light Skin Tone)\n🙋 The Original Emoji Pack\n\nThen be sure to uncheck \"Strip snippets of 'auto expand' flag!\"\n👍🏿👍🏾👍🏽👍🏼👍🏻\nThe why\nI've been a regular macOS user for over a decade now, and I love the Spotlight model of launching applications.  It's basically baked into my brain that every app I open will be launched by typing its name, no matter the context.\nSince I've already built up this muscle memory, I'm really enjoying my recent exploration of Alfred.  Though it's taken some time to retrain some habits to redirect them to that Alfred motif, it's so great to be able to interact with even more parts of the tools that I use with this same process.\nAlfred doesn't just provide a Spotlight replacement; it also provides other productivity tools, like text replacement when you type certain keys.  For example, here's a UUID I created by typing :uuid::\n\nBEFE04B5-2B41-4FF3-BAF2-54632CBFF8AF\n\nI also use emoji a lot when I communicate.  Especially recently, with most of my communication with coworkers happening over Slack, it's important to be able to convey my personality and come across as having a positive demeanor.  I've optimized my use of emoji so that I just automatically type the universally-accepted shortcode for each emoji, like :+1: for 👍🏻.\nJoel Califa created a pack of snippets to automatically replace those shortcodes in all contexts, so that right now, in my text editor, I could just type :bee: and get the 🐝 emoji.  However, these use the unmodified human emoji, which I don't use — as you'll see above, I've decided to use emoji with the Fitzpatrick modifier the represents me.\nInstead of attempting to describe why this snippet pack is so cool, I'm just going to point at Joel's blog post above —&nbsp;it does a much better job of describing all the use you can get out of it and the problems it solves than I ever could!\nThe how\nSo:  how does this work?\nBig thanks to Joel, who responded for my request to make derivative work from his original emoji pack within 10 minutes of my sending the message to him!  I'm really appreciative the he both extended this permission but was also excited about the project.\nYou can find the code that generates these emoji packs in this Github repository: https://github.com/tjwds/alfred-emoji-fitzpatrick\nAs for the implementation, it's fairly straight-forward:  we iterate over the list of shortcodes provided by Joel, replacing any appropriate emoji, and and assigning new GUIDs.  This creates five directories, which I can then import into Alfred to create an exportable snippet pack.\nThe future\nI think there are a few more things that I could do to improve these packs:\nFirst of all, the process for distributing these files is a little onerous.  The snippet packs are just zipped directories filled with json files with a manifest; theoretically, this should be something that I can automate.  So, next time I update the emoji in the pack, I'll probably tackle that first.\nAlso, it'd be nice to add more emoji!  This will involve adding another source other than Joel's files somehow, but that shouldn't be too difficult.\nIf there's any emoji you find are missing, or if you see any problems with the implementation, please either drop me a line at joewoods@fastmail.com or leave an issue on the Github repository.\n👋🏻\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/alfred-emoji-modified/","title":"The Alfred Emoji Pack (with skin-tone modifiers)"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/analytics/":{"body":"After circulating a blog post I wrote, I realized I had three questions:\n\nHow do I track views on a Github Pages blog in a way that respects my users' privacy?\nWhat's a cheap option for web analytics that isn't Google Analytics?\nWhat on earth am I doing?  What do all of these words mean?\n\n\nBut really, why doesn't Github offer some way of tracking page views?  I'm sure you have this data, Microsoft, and it seems like more and more folks are using Pages…\nBut anyway, I did what any sane software engineer would do and way overthought a web analytics solution for myself. During this process, I sketched out what my ideal paid web analytics service would look like, and I briefly toyed with the idea of setting up some monstrosity of an AWS service to do exactly what I wanted to do.\nBut, in the end, I landed on a tried and true technology:  I implemented a tracking pixel.\nI wouldn't consider this a guide for how to do this yourself, per se.

Film and photography use this color space (or one close to it) to represent vivid colors that are closer to real life.  This gives color that \"HDR\" feel.

Yes, RSS.  I've very recently started subscribing to RSS feeds for software releases, so naturally my site needs a feed too.\nAdding this in Zola is really straight-forward:  first, tell Zola to generate RSS in your config.toml file:\n# adds /rss.xml\ngenerate_rss = true\n\nYou should also add a reference to it the head of your templates — if you're like me and everything extends the same index template, this is simple:\n&lt;meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"{{config.base_url | safe}}/{{current_path | safe}}\" /&gt;\nMeta, Open Graph, Twitter card\nYou'll see a lot of bias in my implementation here:  I don't define a site-wide picture (yet?) because I can't think of one that I want to add right now, and I've skipped some meta information that other people might want to add, like your Facebook Brand Id.  I'm also duplicating the description tag for each metadata collection type, mostly out of laziness… it's not strictly necessary to overwrite the meta description with, say, the og:description property, but I figure it doesn't hurt in case someone's written a really bizarre meta tag parser.\nSo, generally, you should use what I'm doing on my site as more of a general idea of how to accomplish this in Zola, without copying what I've done exactly.  Do your own research as to what meta tags you want to include.\nIn my index template, I have a big block of meta tags that are separated into two sections:  things which will be true for every page on the site, and things that should be overwritten in specific articles.  The latter category has been placed in a meta_content block:\n&lt;meta name=\"twitter:card\" content=\"summary\"&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"twitter:site\" content=\"@tjwds\"&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"twitter:creator\" content=\"@tjwds\"&gt;\n&lt;meta property=\"og:type\" content=\"article\" /&gt;\n&lt;meta property=\"og:url\" content=\"{{config.base_url | safe}}/{{current_path | safe}}\" /&gt;\n&lt;meta property=\"og:site_name\" content=\"Joe Woods —&nbsp;Blog\" /&gt;\n\n{% block meta_content %}\n&lt;title&gt;Joe Woods –&nbsp;Blog&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"Joe Woods —&nbsp;Blog\"&gt;\n&lt;meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Joe Woods —&nbsp;Blog\" /&gt;\n{% endblock meta_content %}\n\nWhich I then programmatically overwrite on my page template:\n{% block meta_content %}\n    {% if page.title %}\n    &lt;title&gt;{{page.title}} —&nbsp;Joe Woods&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"{{page.title}} —&nbsp;Joe Woods\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"{{page.title}} —&nbsp;Joe Woods\" /&gt;\n    {% else %}\n    &lt;title&gt;Joe Woods –&nbsp;Blog&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"twitter:title\" content=\"Joe Woods —&nbsp;Blog\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"Joe Woods —&nbsp;Blog\" /&gt;\n    {% endif %}\n    {% if page.description %}\n    &lt;meta name=\"description\" content=\"{{ page.description | safe }}\" /&gt;\n    &lt;meta name=\"twitter:description\" content=\"{{ page.description | safe }}\"&gt;\n    &lt;meta property=\"og:description\" content=\"{{ page.description | safe }}\" /&gt;\n    {% endif %}\n{% endblock meta_content %}\n\n\"What sort of article isn't going to have a title??\" I hear you interject.

You can find the source on Github.\n\nTech Stack\nZola\nThe pages are written and stored as markdown files, which are built with Zola.  Zola is pretty great —&nbsp;it does exactly what's on the tin, and though it's nearly impossible to search for documentation for it due to an unfortunate collision with another brand's name, everything about the way Zola projects are created is pretty intuitive.  It seems like there's not a lot of folks who are currently using it because there really aren't a lot of tutorials that aren't official documentation on random folks' blogs, like you tend to find with other platforms.\nNevertheless, self-discovery with the templating engine that Zola uses, Tera, is fairly straight-forward if you're used to any other templating engine.  Honestly, if you've used one, you've used them all at this point.\nTravis CI and Github Pages\nThis is sort of silly, but I didn't really give a lot of thought to where I was going to host this blog, or even how it was going to be built.  I sort of arrived at the \"JAM Stack\" on accident, just because so many things about it are abstracted away to a point where I don't really have to think about it.  I really enjoy the CI deployment structure of other projects I've worked on, where I don't even need to push a button after committing to the publish branch —&nbsp;it just does it for me.\nZola has some pretty good documentation for Github Pages and Travis CI, so I decided to give that a shot.  At time of writing, the Zola documentation doesn't mention that Ubuntu Xenial (16.04, the Travis CI default) fails to build Zola for some reason or other, so I've just added the line dist: bionic to my config to build on 18.04 instead.  I also had to add a CNAME file to my static folder to make sure I didn't destroy my custom subdomain with every push, which was a frustrating problem to try to find an answer to.\nGithub Pages works, but it doesn't have a great user experience, in my opinion.  It feels like the whole feature is just a hack that was laid on top of Github that an ecosystem has slowly evolved around… but the feature on Github hasn't really been updated to match.\nFor instance, why on earth does my repo name need to be username.github.io when I'm using my own domain?  And now, even though I'm a Github Pro user, if I want to add another Github Pages project, I'll need to create a new organization.  That's not fun.\nWith that being said, I'm hoping that the decision to not host anything myself here will mean that I can not worry about whether or not this site is up!\nFeatures\nTypography\nZola has built-in SCSS support.  I wanted to make sure that I wasn't spending a lot of time styling this blog, but I also wanted to get it right, you know?\nEverything is measured in ems.  This is so our breakout images and code snippets (more detail below) don't break if the browser has increased the font size.  It's also way more of a breeze to handle the margin and padding for any individual elements when it's in portions of an em!\nFigure template\nOne of the first things I did was to create a figure shortcode for my articles.  I'm a hobbyist photographer and wanted to be sure I was happy with the way images are displayed here, so I created a shortcode template:\n&lt;figure {% if class %}class=\"{{class}}\"{% endif %}{% if title %}alt=\"{{title}}\" title=\"{{title}}\"{% else %}alt=\"\"{% endif %}&gt;\n    &lt;img src={{src}} /&gt;\n    {% if content %}\n    &lt;figcaption&gt;\n        {{ content | safe }}\n    &lt;/figcaption&gt;\n    {% endif %}\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n\nEssentially, everything is optional but the image src.  The shortcode is invoked as follows anywhere, be it in an html template or in markdown:\n\n{​{ figure(\n    title=\"Fog on Mountain\"\n    src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1497216429614-5bd7dbd9fc48?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=2252&amp;q=80\"\n    content=\"Photo by &lt;a href='https://unsplash.com/photos/tLDeO8lTgII'&gt;Joe Woods on Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;\"\n) }}\n\nAnd here's the result!\n\n    \n    \n        Photo by Joe Woods on Unsplash\n    \n\nCode snippets\nZola has built-in support for code syntax highlighting, which is very convenient.  I've kept everything as provided out of the box (for now?) because I find whichever color theme I'm now using to be pretty good!  I've added a little bit of padding to the text, as well as applied some more space between each line and letter form to make things a little more legible (for me, at least).  You'll also notice that on wider monitors, the code snippets will take up a little more space than the width of our text column, but will collapse in with a horizontal, scrolling overflow if we don't have enough room.\nHere's an example:\nfor (let i = 1; i &lt;= 100; i++) {\n    if (!(i % 15)) {\n        console.log(\"FizzBuzz\");\n    }\n    else if (!(i % 3)) {\n        console.log(\"Fizz\");\n    }\n    else if (!(i % 5)) {\n        console.log(\"Buzz\");\n    }\n    else {\n        console.log(i);\n    }\n}\n\"234567890123456789 1234567890123456789 1234567890123456789 123456789012345678\";\nConclusion\nI've been writing more lately, so hopefully being able to easily and quickly deploy new blog posts will mean that I'll share more!\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/new-blog/","title":"New Blog"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/":{"body":"Here are some general updates as to what I've been up to, as well as other general thoughts or musings.\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/","title":"Life Updates"},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202004/":{"body":"Hi, welcome to the first monthly update.  It was just April 2020.\nIt's been a weird time for everyone, I think, in a lot of ways that are hard to talk about.\nThis blog is very much inspired by the Tom 7 radar, which has been running in some form since March 2000.  Now, a little over 20 years later, I'm starting mine; so, if you're reading this from May 2040, welcome.\nWho is this for?  I don't know!  Some folks might be interested in the parts of this article that discuss software engineering; others might enjoy the part where I talk about the two additional surfaces to sit on that I've acquired this month.  If you feel your eyes start to glaze over, please feel free to skim.\nMusic\nI published another blog post with tiny reviews of songs which came out recently, which you can find here.  Here's the playlist:\n\nFurniture\nI bought an office chair.  It's not the sort of chair you sit in and think \"dang, this is comfortable,\" but it is the sort of chair that I look at and think \"dang, that looks great.\"  I think I prefer the former over the latter.\n\n    \n\nI also got a couch for the back deck.  In the years that we've lived in this apartment, I'd been considering getting some sort of additional furniture for out there —&nbsp;we have a table and chairs, which is nice for a cuppa or a meal, but not great for extended comfort for reading and the like.  The weather's been pretty miserable in Philly, but I did get to have one lovely post-work reading session out there while wearing a jacket, and I'm really looking forward to taking a nap outside on my outside sofa.\n\n    \n\nFailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published three works:\nBy Anna B. Sutton, \"Wilmington\" and \"Garden of Earthly Delights,\" two poems which are gorgeous slices of Americana that I find have a very slightly sinister something in them.\n\"A Good Hour\" by J.R. Angelella, a relatively short, punchy scene in a short fiction piece.\nCheck 'em out!\nReading\nIn the world of literature, I'm started reading 2666 by Roberto Bolaño just before the start of this month.  It's good so far, but I'm having trouble justifying the more violent sections and it's probably not the best thing to be reading right before bed.\nFor software, I've read some of the books which comprise You Don't Know JS Yet, which is very detailed and very opinionated.  I've also poured over many wikipedia articles on software design patterns, which I'm considering a sort of textbook, and it has really helped plug some gaps in my general knowledge of computer science.\nSoftware projects\nWord Rectangle\nI redid my solution to the word rectangle problem, which you can now find here.\nFrom my description on Github:\n\n\"Uh……… what is this?\" I hear you ask.  Great question.\nA word rectangle is a rectangle of letters which comprise words when read horizontally or vertically.  Behold:\nG L A S S E S\nR E L A P S E\nI M I T A T E\nS M E A R E D\nT A N N E R Y\n\nThis is a brute-force solution to this problem.  It runs on a Raspberry Pi on my desk.\nYou can read more about the word rectangle and its history on Wikipedia.\nThis version reduces the amount of work for each iteration and also has some tests.\n\nThat last sentence is seriously an understatement:  I'm reusing a lot more work now, and the tests exist and are useful (though incomplete, of course).  The raspberry pi on my desk is still happily occupied, looking at some words.  At time of writing, it's checking to see if there are any 14-character-long squares where the first row is the word artificializes.  I would bet that there won't be.\nWeather Dashboard\n\n    \n\nI have given up all pretense that my personal weather dashboard is for anyone but myself.  You can see the code here, it's live at https://wttr.joewoods.dev/.  It's still broken in many of the same delightful ways, and honestly, I just sort of glaze over it now.  If any of the precipitation or air quality charts look strange out of the corner of my eye, I might take a deeper look, but I don't really look at the wttr.in corner of the page anymore (the text-based forecast) because I've started using iStat Menus again, which has a very good weather thing that I might write more about later.\nI also added the most recent GOES-East composite image, which is basically a snapshot of what one half of the planet looks like, updated every hour in surprisingly close to real time.  They even have a 118 megapixel version that you can find if you click don't care about how large this file is and want to click this link.\n\n    \n    \n        A surprisingly up to date image of one half of the planet.  Roughly 18% of humans live in this image!\n    \n\nI won't lie and say my main goal here wasn't to make a homepage for my browser that looks cool.\nIt is really nice to have another sanity check on top of the other ones I have (a discord bot, questions from other people) to let me know when one of my sites inevitably goes down for a new and exciting reason.\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 770,391 keys and clicked 159,417 times.\nI listened to 2,151 songs.\n27 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet.\nI wrote 20502 words in my personal journal.\n\nI used to wear a Fitbit every day, which this section would have been perfect for, but I've stopped wearing it because I phased out a lot of its features from my life over time:  I turned off the notifications so I wasn't encouraged to feel like I needed to respond to every message immediately, and I stopped looking at the number of steps I took each day because I've been socially distanced and walking far less than I normally do.\nThat's it!

Here's the playlist:\n\nPlanting\n\n    \n\nM got us a lemon tree, which I helped her plant.  His name is Stanley, and he joins Zadok in the semi-tropical bedroom tree club.  Essentially, unless we ever get rid of these guys (and I hope we never do), they're going to have to live in the bedroom — we have to make sure we keep the cats away from it, and he definitely wouldn't survive the Pennsylvanian winters.\nWe also did some slight rearranging on the back porch, making sure our herbs have enough room to grow for the upcoming season.\nProgramming\nDuolingo KanjiDamage helper\nI wrote a small little Greasemonkey script to add KanjiDamage links to the Duolingo vocabulary page.  It only works when loading the vocabulary page, but I may clean it up and share it in the future.\nCaution:  the content on KanjiDamage is extremely not safe for work.  Proceed with caution!\nI have been doing Duolingo pretty regularly, but of course, I can't just completely trust their \"let us handle everything about your language learning experience for you\" approach.  Sometimes I'll feel like I need to go and get additional context from an external source, which is, you know, to be expected when you learn a language.  This is where KanjiDamage mostly comes in, for me:  I feel like I've been doing a very bad job of actually learning the kanji as opposed to learning how to recognize them.\nJAMstack access logs\nI've come up with a rather silly way of tracking who has accessed this blog, which I wrote more about here.  Basically, there's a single static asset which lives on one of my Digital Ocean boxes, and then I can read the access logs there.  Since writing the blog post which explains how and why I did this, I've also written a little script for myself which will pull down the logs from the server and reformat them, geolocating the IP, and making the user agent string more readable.\nThis is, of course, giving me other ideas, so I've also started toying with how I could make this scale for other sites that I run.  I've played around with how I could host the files on S3, and I also read the Sails documentation and poked at it a little bit to see if I could build some sort of visualization of the data I already have.\nReading\nThis month I read Marja Hölttä's Understanding the ECMAScript spec series and spent a lot of time organizing my RSS feeds.  I've sort of unofficially challenged myself to read every single article ever posted on web.dev's blog, but in order to accomplish this, I had to radically rethink the way that I save things to read, removing them from the main RSS feed bucket and giving them their own section in Reeder.\nSo, with this being my new mission, I also need to make sure that I read more articles on web.dev than are published each week, which is quite a lot!  That being said, I really do think that this is the best use of the time I've set aside in my life to gain general programming knowledge right now — web.dev is likely the closest thing to a textbook of best practices for developing for the web that exists.\nAlso, working on an email service, I have finally gotten around to reading the IMAP specification (4rev1).\nI am still reading 2666.  I have finally escaped to the other side of \"The Part about the Crimes,\" which was a real slog, and horrible to read right before bed.  I really enjoyed all of the other chapters, so I hope the final chapter will be as good as the others, but it was very hard to make it through that chapter, on the scale of Moby Dick and Infinite Jest.  As I read, I like to evaluate how I'm currently enjoying what I'm reading, which usually takes the form of \"what rating would I give this book on Goodreads right now?\"  Right now I'm sitting at a two, but before this chapter, I was thinking four or five.\nfailbetter\nfailbetter published two poems from John Grey, \"Coma\" and \"Reasons to Shoot the Guy\".  We also published a short fiction piece, \"Angie Rubio’s Report Card by Angie Rubio’s Mother\", from Donna Miscolta.\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 740,000 keys (-30,391) and clicked 154,217 (-5,200) times.\nI listened to 2098 songs (-53).\n22 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet (-5).\nI wrote 23575 words in my personal journal (+3073).\n\nThat's it!

I think it's become clear that we're in this for the long haul.  Are we, as humans, going to be able to get our act together and change the world so that each and every person can be treated with not just dignity, but respect and even gratitude?\nI'm so glad that soccer is back.  I've been watching the Bundesliga, EPL, and NWSL.  I really love the beautiful game, and I look forward to watching a match in basically every time slot that I can each weekend.\nMusic\nI published another blog post with tiny reviews of songs which came out recently, which you can find here.  Here's the playlist:\n\nPlanting\nWe (well, almost entirely M) did a small amount of planting on the porch.  My big project was migrating this succulent to a new planter; some of its pups got moved to new tiny pots.\n\n    \n\nProgramming\nSo:  not going to lie, I didn't write that much code outside of work this month.  I worked a little bit on learning Sails, but nothing of note to talk about yet.  I did spend some time designing the future of failbetter's infrastructure, though, so I hope to spend more time implementing that soon.\nBut all the time that I normally spend writing code for fun this month was essentially taken up by my reading about code and organizing my flashcard system.\nFlashcards\nI have fully re-embraced Anki.  A few years ago, I finished Glutanimate's \"Great Works of Art\" deck, having memorized most of the artists for every card included in the deck.  I also occasionally add cards for works that I've seen in real life and snapped a picture of as well.  However… I let this slide for a few years, so I'm finding that I have to relearn quite a few of these!\nI've also taken the effort to reorganize my decks:  I have decks for words that I can't spell correctly, programming concepts and APIs, general trivia, and thoughts about life (\"reflections\") that I want to make sure I keep in mind.\nHere's some examples.  Figuring out which deck each flashcard belongs to is left as an exercise for the reader:\n\nHow can you make an element's background be translucent, blurred, or similar effects with CSS?  What is its syntax?\n\"If this isn't nice, I don't know what is.\"\nCapital of and largest city in Iceland\nHow far away is the moon?\n\nReading\nI finally (finally!) finished 2666 after about three months.  I have so many mixed feelings about this novel.  Was it a good book?  I don't know, probably not.  Was it engaging?  Very much so, for the most part.  \"The Part about the Crimes\" was a slog of a chapter to get through.  As a whole, the book's project definitely worked.  I would be happy if this one replaced Infinite Jest in basically every way.\nI also read Ancillary Mercy, the final book in the Imperial Radch series by Ann Leckie.  I thought it was enjoyable, but I didn't get as invested in it as I think I would have wanted.\nAs far as programming, I finished my project of reading every single web.dev article — at time of writing, my RSS reader now has 135 read entries.  I found this pretty useful and enjoyable.  Near the end of the project, I noticed that I was skimming a bit more, because there was a little bit of repetition, but I learned about the existence of quite a few browser features, as well as took down some trivia for my flashcards.  web.dev definitely has a heavy slant toward the web that Google wants to see, but that was fine.\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published two equally fantastic pieces:  \"How to become an almost American,\" a short poem by Frank C Modica, and \"Lid Locking Into Place,\" a short story by Sasha Graybosch.\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 820,000 keys (+80,000) and clicked 167,170 (+12,953) times.\nI listened to 1,986 songs (-112).\n33 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet (+11).\nI wrote 22,878 words in my personal journal (-697).\n\nNot bad for a shorter month!\nThat's it!

Here's the RSS feed, and/or you could subscribe via email:\nEnter your email addresspowered by TinyLetter\nI've been writing a lot this month.  I keep a daily journal which forces me to write at least 750 words per day, and I've well worked this into my routine.  But I've also started keeping an agenda which allows me to reflect on my day as it's happening, which means I no longer feel like I need to reflect on my day after it has already happened… which has left me with a habit (writing) with no real target (formerly, my feelings).\nThe great news is that I've been able to mostly convert this habit into planning and writing:  articles, letters, creative endeavors, personal manifestos.  Some of these I even get around to sending out!\nOne such is an article on The Gauntlet, which I've titled:  The Album Gauntlet:  Over-Engineered Music Appreciation.  This is a very in-depth explainer of how I keep track of the albums that come across my desk, and it now means that I no longer get to mysteriously reference \"The Gauntlet\" in the statistics section of these monthly update without only, like, three people knowing what it's referring to.\nMusic\nI published another blog post with tiny reviews of songs which came out recently, which you can find here.  Here's the playlist:\n\nProgramming\nAs for programming projects, I spent some time writing a CLI for moving records around playlists for The Gauntlet.  In its current form, I don't find it very useful, but I'm glad to have written the procedures that I could \"easily\" port into some other alternative interface for Spotify which better fits The Gauntlet.\nMy fiancée and her friend are working on an online store, so I've started working on the Shopify theme and all the bits and pieces that will have to go around it.  I'm still trying to decide how deep the business end of things need to go — for example, I'm considering forming an LLC for a few reasons.  It's easy (though relatively expensive), it affords a retailer certain protections, and it'd be nice to form it as more of an umbrella that I could use for whatever I want.  Also, then I'd have my very own LLC, which would be pretty cool and is something I've wanted for a few years now.\nAt some point Linode emailed me a surprisingly large account credit for some reason unbeknownst to me, so I've taken the opportunity to finally start migrating failbetter off of my terrible old hosting provider.  The first step of this process was getting a modern Drupal install on a modern stack as our staging site.\nAs part of my work to start migrating the content to the new server, I accidentally took down failbetter for about 20 minutes.  Thankfully, this was the middle of a weekend, so I was able to dive in, diagnose, and fix the issue, but still:  this crash is emblematic of why I want to move to the new platform in the first place!  As my own personal post-mortem, I celebrated my ability to dive in and fix the issue without panicking about it.  Well, without panicking about it too much.\nAnd, of course, I've been beginning the process of actually using that new failbetter server.  It's at a currently unguessable URL, but someone's bot still found it and tried to register an account!  For now, I'm beginning the slow process of redesigning the site; hopefully more news on that front next month.\nAlso, this sort of blends into the \"reading\" section below, but I've been reading Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson, Sussman, &amp; Sussman.  It's mostly things I entirely know, but the second I find myself beginning to skim a bit, I'll stumble across a new concept that makes me think for a while.  As such, a lot of my hobby programming time has been taken up crafting my own implementations from or inspired by problems presented in the book.\nReading\nI started The Sweet Spot: How to Accomplish More by Doing Less late last month and finished it early this month.  There were some good nuggets of wisdom here, and I've used to to completely reorganize the way I handle the things I need to do every day.  That being said, reading it was not fun at all.  Not only did each chapter give me more and more homework, it was hard homework — to evaluate myself and my relationship with the world.  Not a very fun project to work on at the end of a work day!\nI also read The Memory Police by Yoko Ogawa.  It was pretty good, and many descriptions of it online don't do it justice.  It's not satisfactory to call it Orwellian, unless \"Orwellian\" means \"any novel with an all-encompassing State in it.\"  It had some very poetic moments, but this was at odds with its translation, which I sometimes felt sacrificed poetry for strict transliteration.  Without spoiling too much, nothing in this novel ever really gets resolved, which is both frustrating and a suppose a little thought-provoking.\nFinally, I decided to start re-reading Consider Phlebas by Iain M. Banks.  I've already read it, and fairly recently — within the past, what, four years? — but the Culture series brought me a lot of joy, and it's interesting to read this novel now with the perspective of the rest of the Culture's backstory now wedged somewhere in this brain.\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published a gripping short story, \"Little White Seas,\" by Therin Alrik.  We also published a haunting poem by James Braun, \"The Singing House.\"\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 870,000 keys (+50,000) and clicked 227,561 (+60,391) times. (I've been playing cookie clicker.)\nI listened to 2095 songs (+109).\n27 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet (-6).\nI wrote 24,030 words in my personal journal (+1152).\n\nThat's it!

Here's the RSS feed, and/or you could subscribe via email here:\nEnter your email addresspowered by TinyLetter\nIt's been a weird month, but you all know that, because we're all having one weird month after another.  But this one has been somehow more strange for me; I've felt simultaneously immensely productive and unproductive, active and lazy.\nLately I've been thinking a lot about two things:  who do I want to be? and how do I actually finish projects?\nI haven't figured either of those out yet.  But maybe I will soon!\nMusic\nI published another blog post with tiny reviews of songs which came out recently, which you can find here.  Here's the playlist:\n\nBikes\nWhen I was in college, I did a brief stint of work in the university's bicycle repair shop, where I learned a handful of things about maintaining bicycles which I promptly stopped using once I moved to Philadelphia.\nBut:  no longer!  After two years of these bikes just sitting on our back porch disassembled, everything was in working order, minus a bunch of rust and some questionable brakes on my bike.  Only one tube needed to be replaced, which I consider a minor miracle.\nSo:  it's now possible for us to get around a little bit more.  And now all I want to do is go hop on my bike and stare at the Delaware for a little while…\n\n    \n\nProductivity\nI have rearranged my RSS habits yet again, getting them to a state that I'm … mostly happy with.  I now have one big bucket which lives in Feedbin, which consists of:\n\nBuckets and sub-buckets of content via RSS feed\nMy pinboard read-later feed\n\nAnd then I use Reeder and Readably on my laptop and phone, respectively, making the workflow look something like…\n\n    \n    \n        A quick, illegible sketch of websites coming into my bucket of things to read\n    \n\nWhich is a lot of workflow wrangling to get close to a process that still doesn't feel quite right to me, and that I often find myself having to set a whole lot of time aside to get back on top of.\nProgramming\nI worked on some smaller projects outside of work this month, but nothing really of note to share, because I didn't get any to a state that I could write about.  But that's going to happen, I suppose!  One such is the beginnings of a framework to use a Raspberry Pi to do complex computation and then email me about it, but I need to spend more time with it in order for the project to become actually useful. The most notable thing here, though, is that I've made the decision to try to write every personal project in typescript now.\nI am still reading SICP.  (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson, Sussman, &amp; Sussman.)  This marks the second month that I've spent working on it, chunk by chunk, and if I keep it up at this rate — about half an hour a day — I will likely finish it up before the end of next month.  This endeavor really is making me a better programmer, though; though it's rare that there's a concept introduced by the book that I don't already know about, often it puts a new, more accurate or concise name to it, and opens up more avenues to consider or manipulate said topic further.  Plus, I'm learning a whole lot more math.  Just by virtue of sitting down and thinking about algorithms, I'm forging these neural pathways that make me come to elegant solutions to problems I can solve with software.\nI'll admit that the going has been tough on getting through this book.  It's clearly not my highest priority in my life right now, whereas if I had to be doing it for a class, I'd be able to put the time in.  But I've finally gotten to the chapters which discuss interpreter design and implementation, which means I'm spending less time getting bogged down in math I don't know and more time breezing through the concepts I do know but don't yet have a name for.\nAlso, the last thing I'll say about it is that I'm getting an appreciation for the history of programming that I didn't previously have.  The hot debates in computer science from the very late 70s are really fun to observe 30 years later.\nReading\nAs I mentioned last month, I wrapped up Consider Phlebas.  It's sort of weird coming back to this novel after having experienced (almost) everything the canonical universe of the Culture has to offer; I'll never be able to read this novel for the first time again, and it was a completely different experience this time around.  The second read-through I didn't quite find it as life-altering as the first, but it was still great.  And now I'll never be able to read it for the second time ever again!\nI also read the first four works in the first movement of The Murderbot Diaries, which were a lot of fun.  I think it says a lot that I picked up the next novella in the series immediately after finishing each subsequent one!  I am going to take some time off before conquering the novel which sits in position number five in the list, though.\nFor the most part, I found these really great.  Each book was sort of the same, but deviated from the formula enough to remain interesting.  They're all certainly page-turners, and I looked forward to my opportunities to keep reading them, which was very nice.  The only complaint is that I didn't find the main character very believable in a lot of ways — the character's motivations are often contradictory, and not in a \"this character is conflicted\" way, but a \"it doesn't make sense that this feeling would happen here for this character for any reason other than to advance the plot\" way.  There's a lot of tiny deus ex machina moments which come out of the same character.  Really, what I'm trying to say is that Murderbot is basically just Goku.  Which isn't a bad thing.\nFinally, I picked up Florence Adler Swims Forever by fellow Virginia Commonwealth University English master's graduate Rachel Beanland.  I seriously only started reading this book because Beanland graduated from the same department as me (though I believe she received the MFA while I received the MA).  It's a really gripping book, but it's devastatingly tragic.

Here's the RSS feed, and/or you could subscribe via email here:\nEnter your email addresspowered by TinyLetter\nThis is not the first time I've talked about feeling weird attempting to carve out my own little positive space in these monthly reports, but writing this on the morning of September 30th, that same thought comes to mind.\nI'm doing fine — great, even.  I'm still terrified about what's going on in the world around me.  But life's still going on over here.  The 200th day since I've been working from home has come and gone.  Things that I was looking forward to have come to pass, only to be supplanted by new things to look forward to.\nHere are some things that happened this month.  My month was great, and I hope, despite everything, yours was too.\nMusic\nI published another blog post with tiny reviews of songs which came out recently, which you can find here.  Here's the playlist:\n\nLife\nI wrote and published an article about my experience in getting serious about learning Japanese, and what I've learned 150 days in.  I'm not sure how often I'll be publishing these, but I'm sure I'll write one once I either hit one year or a significant milestone.  So, if you're curious about how I approach languages or learning in general, or curious about how much progress I've made in these five months, go check it out!\nThis article also encouraged me to broaden the category that the above article and this article sit in — now that this category doesn't only have these monthly updates, I've turned it into a more general \"Life Updates.\"\nI also took the \"Overhead on the Subway\" and made it a single post as opposed to its own category, since, you know, it's been a while since I've been on the subway, let alone overheard anything on it.  This left room for me to add a new \"Other Thoughts\" category, which will mostly serve as a \"ehh, I don't really know if all of this deserves its own bucket yet\" bucket.\nAlso being released at the same time as this post is a post that represents the total sum of my work on how to be good at researching things —&nbsp;\"How to Take Notes on a Text.\"  It's a lot, but hopefully you'll get something out of it that you can use in your own life.\nThat's a lot about my blog, but not a lot about my life!  All I really have to report is that I had my own little time_t party this month:\n\n    \n    \n        1️⃣6️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣0️⃣\n    \n\nProgramming\nI didn't spend a lot of time writing code outside of work this month!  A lot of that is probably because I've been playing with tooling a lot — I spent a lot of time on my config files this month, as well as setting up Alfred to be more of an extension of the way I work.  Also, I suppose I've just been reading more as well.\nI spent a little bit of time this month working on failbetter's infrastructure, but not as much as I would have liked.\nA sort of silly amount of my time this month went into waiting for and then configuring the Powkiddy V90, a \"retro\" emulation device designed to look just like the Gameboy Advance SP.  It's a lot of fun, but trying to sysadmin a gameboy was a little frustrating.  I have already written so many configuration files for this dang thing, but even that was fun in its own way.  But now it's running the Gameboy Color emulator of my choice, I've figured out and mitigated the bug where games just weren't being saved, and I've fixed up the sort of bonkers file structure that the device came with.  And now I have this cool, extremely cheap fake Gameboy!\nI wrote a script to take Joel Califa's Alfred snippets to replace emoji shortcodes with their actual emoji and create five new bundles of basically the same content, but with skin-tone modifiers applied, so that I can type :wave: and have my text automatically replaced with 👋🏻.  I wrote a whole lot more about this in yet another blog post called \"The Alfred Emoji Pack (with skin-tone modifiers)\".  The code lives here, and I'm glad to say that my \"I only write typescript now\" mindset is continuing.\nI also did a bit of work to straighten up my browser homepage, which is a very stylized weather dashboard:\n\n    \n    \n        An updated, too-cool weather dashboard.\n    \n\nIt's live here, and the repo is here.  It needs a whole lot of work to clean it up, but since this is only for me, I've been taking the extremely lazy way out in a lot of ways.\nReading\nLike I mentioned above… I spent way more time reading this month and way less time writing code!\nNonfiction\nWell, at the beginning of this month, I decided to stop reading SICP.  I read the penultimate chapter and skimmed the last chapter, but I don't really feel like I was engaging enough with it anymore, so I set it aside.  Maybe one day I'll come back to it, but I was getting a bit impatient and felt like I should move on to more current things…\n…So I immediately read the out-of-date HTML 5 Hacks.  I think I got this in a Humble Book Bundle long ago, but the title grabbed me, so I gave it a try.  It came out in 2012.  I mostly skimmed the last few chapters, as they focused on implementations that are now (mostly) out of date with technologies that I'm either already (mostly) familiar with, or discussed frameworks that I was interested in mostly due to how they shaped the tools we use now-a-days.\nI'm sure when the book came out it would have been both revolutionary and helpful, but I believe its time has come and gone already.  I was frustrated by it, because more than once I thought that a topic it described was cool and was astonished that I hadn't heard about it, only to learn that I hadn't heard about it because the feature is deprecated — like, for example, the Microdata DOM API.\nThe language of the book was also greatly out of date; it's a good snapshot about how people used to talk about programming and programmers in general.  For example, I only counted one real hack:  Internet Explorers 6–8 ignore semantic HTML5 tags like, say, &lt;article&gt;.  However, you can add the tag to the browser's tag list by executing a script early that creates an element which you ignore by invoking something like document.createElement('article');.  Now the element is in the browser's list of acceptable elements and your page will… continue to be broken, because it's IE 8.\nI also started on The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks.  So far, I've found it a bit chauvinistic, almost to the point that the morals and messages it attempts to convey are diluted and obscured by its tone and underlying biases.  I'm sure I'll have a lot more to say once I finish the book, but I want to come out of this book with more strategies for how projects get organized while still maintaining my belief that you should plan for the worst but hope for the best.\nFiction\nI finished Rachel Beanland's Florence Adler Swims Forever.  It was good, but extremely sad.  It was also fun to see some folks I know in real life, like fellow failbetter editor Thom Didato, get well-deserved shout-outs in the novel's acknowledgements.\nNext, I read Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb.  Dang, what a fun ride.  Such a good book.  I'm sort of astonished that it doesn't seem like this series has gotten more traffic — where's my HBO series for this trilogy?  I highly recommend this novel.  I decided to to take a short break before picking up the next book…\n…So after that, I read the recently-released Network Effect by Martha Wells.  This is the fifth work in the Murderbot Diaries series, and the first to be a full-length novel (as opposed to a novella).  It was pretty good!  I feel like these books are starting to get a little formulaic, but this one, like the others, was a page-turner.  And yes, Murderbot is still a completely unbelievable character, but that still doesn't really subtract from the fun.\nThen, after that, I hopped right back into the Farseer Trilogy with Royal Assassin.  I've made a bit of progress on this one, but I'm sure I'll have something to say about it next month!\nAnd though I linked to it in the intro of this post, I can't go without mentioning 20020.  Jon Bois has definitely struck gold again; the first two updates are just as good as I remember 17776 being.  I highly recommend that you don't miss this one —&nbsp;just click the link and start reading!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published the tragic and beautiful short story \"Elphinstone\" by Anu Kandikuppa, as well as the cerebral and dark \"Things Stay with You\" by Ann Gelder.\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 873,223 keys (+13,223) and clicked 193,107 (-29,865) times.\nI listened to 2514 songs (+201).\n34 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet (+6). (This is surely skewed because a few of these were EPs.)\nI wrote 24,875 words in my personal journal (+1,166).\n\nThat's it!  Thanks for reading.

Here's the RSS feed, and/or you could subscribe via email here:\nEnter your email addresspowered by TinyLetter\nWell, it's my last blog post before the 2020 election, which is basically going to be the only thing on my mind until whatever happens finally sinks in, probably days if not weeks after the results roll in.\nI know you're sick of hearing it, and I am to.  But please vote if you can.\nI spend a lot of time thinking about the little time capsules my interactions with the world are leaving behind.  It's Halloween; I walked around a little bit and only took one photo, which is going immediately into the slideshow I will eventually foist upon others any time this part of human history comes up in the future.\nIn a lot of ways, these monthly posts are an arrow shot into the future.  You are only ever reading this after October 2020 has already passed.  So, here's the summary again:  I had a great time, despite this terrifying world.  I read a lot, and even let myself relax a little bit.  I hope you had a great month too.\nMusic\nI published another blog post with tiny reviews of songs which came out recently, which you can find here.  Here's the playlist:\n\nLife\nI have played so many video games this month.  I'm not going to lie, I've spent a lot of time playing Fortnite.  I thought about writing and article about this, but the gist is:  this game is incredibly addictive, it's so much fun to play with friends, and I was so wrong about it.  It's a lot of fun, especially the new Halloween mode.\nProgramming\nI spent some time this month working on a chatbot for a Discord server that some friends and I have put together.  The bot is clearly inspired by Synergy; I haven't yet cleaned the code up enough to have it be in a shareable state, but I hope to do that soon, once it is more pluggable via configuration files and not, like, manually writing your routes into the message handler's decision tree.\nSo far, the bot can:\n\nTranslate arbitrary text from any language supported by Google Translate into English\nGently admonish someone if they don't yell in the #yelling channel — that is, if their message contains lowercase characters\n\"Follow\" a list of twitter accounts and share their tweets in a channel as they're tweeted\nShare an arbitrary color, which it does once a day as the color of the day\nStart a poll by providing the emoji reactions; either ✅ or ❌ as the default, or with emoji provided by the user.  (Think \"poll:  what should I have for lunch, 🌮  or 🍔?\")\nConvert text to Zalgo\nExclaim in surprise if someone says the randomly-chosen secret word, and pass the \"said the secret word\" role to the person who earned it\n… and a few other secret features!\n\nI have also written the Instagram flavor of the \"put all of the friends in one feed\" feature to join Twitter, but it turns out that Instagram has put a blanket ban on all of on all of DigitalOcean and Linode's IPs, which is extremely lame.  Nor have any of these simple proxy pass websites worked, and I'm very reluctant to run this from my home IP, lest I incur the wrath of an immovable corporate machine.  Please reach out if you have any ideas I can try here!\nI have clearly spent a handful of evenings joking around with folks while implementing these tiny plugins, which has been incredibly fun and a great exercise of these programming skills … but it also means that I've hardly worked on the things that I feel I really should have been working on!\nSpeaking of \"things I should have been working on,\" there was just a little bit of progress on failbetter this month.  I've decided to abandon all of the Drupal 9 work I was doing — nothing against the Drupal project, but the sacrifice of user-friendliness and all of the quirks that come with Drupal's history meant that I decided to pull the plug on trying to stay on Drupal.  I'm now experimenting with WordPress, and I think this is the right move, but it's going to take some work to make the content presentation feel like a storied journal with over a decade of history, rather than \"Just another WordPress site,\" as the slogan on the default WordPress installation always implies.\nReading\nFirst I finished off Royal Assassin by Robin Hobb. It was pretty good, though it would be hard to live up to the first one. I felt like there was a lot of setup to this novel, only for the ending to be very different from what I was expecting. I was honestly a little disappointed by the ending, but I finished it and immediately found myself looking forward to the next.\nNext, by recommendation from a friend, I read Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn. I didn't really find it fun, but the plot had the same motion as a train-wreck you can't look away from. It definitely feels like a story that would do better in the format of film, so I might give the movie try soon.\nThen, of course, I had to round out the Farseer Trilogy with Assassin's Quest.  This book was an interesting finalization of this story arc — though it's clearly not the end to that character's story.  It was definitely an interesting and engaging book that I had a hard time putting down, but I found many of the character's decisions extremely frustrating, and some of the obstacles that character overcame too suddenly vanquished.  Nevertheless, I very highly recommend this trilogy, but I'm having a hard time not letting Robin Hobb's work just completely take over my reading time.  There are sixteen books that take place in this universe!  I'm only 19% done, and Robin Hobb is still writing!  Maybe if I read one of her books as every third book, I'll finish these roughly this time two years from now.\nI also finished The Mythical Man-Month by Fred Brooks.  There are nuggets of wisdom here, but for the most part, I think most of the wisdom imparted by this book has already spread out so wide that I'd heard it in some form or another.  It was useful to see a few of these arguments in context, though.  That all being said, some of the rhetoric in this text points at a deep-rooted chauvinism that shouldn't be excused.\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published two short stories:  \"Saint of the Day\" by Rosemary Harp, and then what is probably one of my favorite works we've ever published, \"The Heavy One\" by Chika Onyenezi.\nSome other stats\nThis month,\nI lost a week of keyboard and mouse data. :-(\n\nI typed at least 790,000 keys and clicked at least 145,168 times.\nI listened to 2,658 songs (+144).\n32 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet (-2)\nI wrote 23,427 words in my personal journal (-1,448).\n\nThat's it!

I've spent a whole lot of time working on projects this month, but also a lot of time working on myself.  I feel like a lot of these things I'm doing are just laying the foundation for even more cool things to come, and it's an exciting feeling!\nI hope you're doing well too.\nMusic\nI published another blog post with tiny reviews of songs which came out recently, which you can find here.  Here's the playlist:\n\nLife\nI've found a new digital home on a Mastodon instance: @tjwds@merveilles.town.  I've been posting there way more often than Twitter!  This instance is a great group of encouraging folks, and I feel like my increased output of work that I find fun and exciting is because I would be so happy if I was a tenth as cool as the folks I've joined in this club.\nI've also started playing the first game that I've found I can actually enjoy in Japanese, 塊魂アンコール — or, in English, Katamari Damacy Reroll.  Really, I've played this game and its sequels and spinoffs so much that I could play it without understanding the text on the screen, but I've learned that I can actually follow things relatively well.  And this is seriously the perfect game for learning the Japanese words for things, because you pick them up with your katamari and then it tells you what you just picked up in the bottom right corner in katakana, not kanji!\nProgramming\nBefore I get to some of those projects Merveilles has spurred me on to do, I've also been able to make really great strides on failbetter.  In addition to a little bit of tooling to automate some of the more tedious tasks, I've finally gotten the migration to a point where I'm happy with, so it finally feels like the timeline I've set for myself is on track.  Exciting stuff!\nThis month, I built an extremely simple static site generator.  I've been using this as a personal wiki, where the questions or knowledge I've accumulated can be put to be shared or stumbled across hopefully well into the future.  One such article is my collection advice about how to really get into using Anki for personal knowledge reinforcement!  And of course, I'm super proud of the simple but clearly cohesive style I put together for this project.\nFinally, I went to very silly lengths to create a tixy.land script that I was happy with.  tixy.land is a creative \"code golf\" playground, where you can modify the color of a small grid of pixels from red to black to white in only 32 characters.  This hack is a combination three realizations: that I could both break the character limitation, that I could make frame-by-frame animations of bitmaps, and that I'd seen that color scheme somewhere before.\n\n    \n    \n        I fell in love once and almost completely.\n    \n\nReading\nThis month, I read Design for Cognitive Bias by David Dylan Thomas, a wonderful, short, semi-introduction to investigating perspective in the design of all things.  It was jovial and jubilant, and definitely a fun read.  Thomas is also in Philly, so all of the references to actual projects in Philadelphia were also lovely, some of which I already had had a very small outsider's perspective on.  I highly recommend it!\nI also started reading Nginx: From Beginner to Pro by Rahul Soni.  I have a few issues with the book, and I don't really think I'm an nginx beginner, nor do I think this book will make me a pro, but I've been learning some things, if not things that are adjacent to but not the core knowledge one needs to be an nginx expert.\nAs for fiction, I've been working through The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu.  I'm not done yet, so I'm sure I'll have more to say about both of those books next month!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published the cute but sad quick fiction \"Order For Friendship\" by Yash Seyedbagheri, as well as the clever and dark \"The Monster under Building A\" by Anne Louise Pepper.\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 792,713 keys and clicked 144,249 times.\nI listened to 2,140 songs.\n6 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet — I've been listening to more music with people rather than just by myself!\nI wrote 23,416 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

I'm thankful that I was able to spend so much of this year working on myself, trying to be the best person I can be and setting myself up for an infinite number of exciting, fantastic futures.\nI've tried to think of some resolutions for the new year, but really, I can't think of anything that I'm not already confident I'm going to do —&nbsp;and that's something I'm awfully dang proud of!\nI hope you're doing well too.  I hope you had a great holiday season, and that you too will go on to do fun, exciting things in 2021.\nMusic\nWow, we did it —&nbsp;that's 11 blog posts across 12 months!  Here's December's post.  And here's the playlist:\n\nLife\nI was very grateful to be able to take two weeks off at the end of December (and very beginning of January, too, technically).  It's been nice to get some rest and relaxation that I didn't quite realize that I needed!\nM got an Oculus Quest 2, which is a seriously fantastic piece of hardware.  I've played through Superhot VR, which was quite fun and silly; I'm also playing Tetris Effect, which is nothing like what I was expecting.  Tetris Effect came out over two years ago now, and based on its promotional materials, I sort of expected it to be this peaceful and pretty experience.  It's certainly a great-looking game, but I did not expect it to be as intense as it is… nor did I really expect for there to be this theme of overarching humanism to come across so heavily.  Basically, I expected a pretty Tetris game, not a message about how your soul can traverse the universe to show how we are all connected — but I'm not complaining, it's pretty fun.  Check out this video of a playthough of a particularly intense level if you're not convinced.\nI have mostly been playing Beat Saber.  I did not realize how large of an arrow-shaped hole was left in my heart by not being able to play Dance Dance Revolution due to the pandemic.  I'm glad that I've fully been able to fill that hole with arrows that fly toward me on blocks instead.  At time of writing, I've only been playing for about a week, but I think I've gotten up to the level where I'm no longer trying to match my existing rhythm game skills to the mechanics of the game, and now I get to just get better and grow.  I've also revived my rhythm game Twitter account, which I created for scoreposting back in February so as not to spam my main Twitter account.  I only had about three weeks in the US to use it, though, before we all stayed home for a while!  I wish there were a Mastodon instance for rhythm games — I am vaguely throwing around the notion of starting one, but I don't really feel linked in to the community enough to do so.\nAnyway, at time of writing, I'm becoming comfortable with Expert songs, absolutely cannot pass Expert+ songs yet, and can sightread near-FCs on Hard.  The skill jump between levels in this game is a pretty wide gulf to cross!\nVR, in general, is super cool.  It feels to me like what the internet in the nineties must have felt like:  astonishing, awesome in the literal sense, hard to comprehend, full of promise, clearly and obviously the future.  I didn't have the skills to really learn how to code back when the internet was expanding — mostly because I was too young — let alone to learn how to build applications on the web.  I'm going to make sure I can at least participate from the sidelines this time around, though!\nI've also spent more time on IRC this month, having spent time migrating fully from Limechat to irssi in tmux.  IRC is a weird place, but you can find me as tjwds on a few servers; the best place to contact me is probably Freenode, as expected.\nFinally, a few friends and I did a digital Secret Santa exchange where we all were assigned someone to make a short video about.  This was really fun, and everyone involved made some really great stuff.  Though we weren't able to meet up in person this year, it was nice to see folks and spread some holiday cheer!\nProgramming\nI spent a whole lot of time on Advent of Code this month.  I did end up giving up halfway though day 20, but that's a lot further than I've gotten in the past!  The beginning was fun, but the last day was very involved and I wrote a bug which I spent more than an hour trying to unravel in day 20 and decided that it just wasn't worth it anymore.  It was really nice to make a routine around writing code that I had to stick to, though.\nI also finally got around to updating my online homepage, which is now live at joewoods.dev.  I tried to make this sort of digital directory / business card at least interesting without being ugly or obnoxious, and I think I did an alright job.  At least it's now more interesting than what was there before, and now hosted at the right domain — that's one fewer property at the old hosting provider to migrate.\nI had been planning to spend a whole lot of time on the failbetter migration this month, and it ultimately ended up going pretty well.  After a few false starts, I was able to write some scripts to automate what parts of the migration could be migrated, though unfortunately, many aspects of the migration require a small human touch… and across over 1,000 works, that really does add up!  Unfortunately, I won't be fully done by the time I go back to work in the new year, but this massive project that I've been planning for quite a while now does seem like it'll be drawing to a close relatively soon.\nReading\nEarly this month, I finished The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu.  I thought it was really… stellar.  Not quite one of my favorite books of all time, but there are little moments in this book that really shine.  Especially the next to last scene.  There's absolutely no feeling of closure that comes from the end of this novel, which is sort of a shame, in my opinion, but that's what the rest of the series is for!\nI also read The Bridge by Iain Banks this month.  It was fine!  There were certain aspects of it that I did like, and others that I didn't, but it was engaging enough to keep me thinking about it for a while.  I just couldn't really identify with any of the characters in this one, which is unlike my typical experience with many of Banks's other works.  Nevertheless, I still enjoyed it.\nAnd to round out the year, I'm currently in the middle of Axiom's End by Lindsay Ellis — more to come when I finish it!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published three works:\n\nA fun and jaunting poem, \"Anthropocene (#1),\" by Jen Town,\nthe contemplative poem \"What I Think About On Concord Street\" by Rachael Hershon,\nand the cheeky, clever short story \"Seeing the Light\" by Andrea Marcusa.\n\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 831,934 keys and clicked 160,568 times.\nI listened to 1,859 songs.\n9 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet\nI wrote 23,454 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

I often talk about these articles as time capsules; if, decades down the line, I or someone else wanted to come and see what I had been up to the month that President Biden was inaugurated, that there was an armed group who was encouraged and succeeded in storming the United States Capitol Building, and that memes took on Wall Street… well, maybe you'd be surprised to see that I did actually manage to get some stuff done this month.\nThings have been just fine for me.  I hope you're doing well too.  This month, I wrote a lot of code for work and a little bit outside of it, somehow.  I read an astonishing amount, and I had a huge success in getting help with the failbetter migration project.\nI hope you had a great month too.\nMusic\nIt's time for year two of the music blog!  I'm toying around with the format a little.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist:\n\nLife\nIt's worth mentioning that I did two things to organize my inboxes this month:\n\nFirst, I migrated all of the newsletters I actually read to Feedbin.  This makes more sense to me, as entries in my email inboxes at work and at home represent items that I need to do, and \"read this thing\" todos fit into a totally different paradigm that I already set up with Feedbin.  This is a pretty great feature, and I'm glad to be able to use it!\nSecondly, I've completely shifted the way I organize emails:  I used to use whether or not an email was unread (that is, the lack of the Seen flag) as whether or not the email needed action.  Now, unread literally just means I haven't looked at the message, and if it's in my inbox, it still represents a thing to do, otherwise, I archive it.\n\nProgramming\nI have been slowly working my way though A Programmer's Introduction to Mathematics by Jeremy Kun.  Though I'm only partway through it, I can already tell that this will be one of my favorite programming books ever, if not my favorite.  Though there are still critical concepts to come in the later chapters, this book has given me the confidence to be able to work through a whole new domain of problems, as well as widening the perspectives and approaches I take in regards to computer science in general.\nAnd it's really nice that my brain no longer turns off when I scan my eyes upon formulas marked up in LaTeX, especially since the vast majority of them mean \"add some stuff together.\"\nOther than that, I didn't get a whole lot done!  No public-facing projects to share this month, though I did write some code here and there.  I have brought someone new onboard to assist me with the non-automatable portions of the failbetter migration, which is a massive relief for me.\nReading\nAt the very beginning of this month, I finished Axiom's End by Lindsay Ellis.  I thought it was alright, and certainly not offensive, but I wasn't the biggest fan of a few of the mechanics of the book.  It does start to pick up the pace as the book progresses, but I also was dissatisfied with the ending.  I don't feel like I wasted my time reading it, though!\nNext, I read Riot Baby by Tochi Onyebuchi.  This was an extremely difficult book, but it is all the better for it.  It really asks a lot of hard questions, and the atmosphere it creates isn't pretty or cinematic, but it's something that I'm glad I was able to read.\nAfter that, one of my friends had given me a physical copy of Recursion by Blake Crouch, promising that I wouldn't be able to put it down.  She was right!  It certainly wasn't a perfect novel, but it was extremely interesting, very gripping, and knew just what to say at the right time to keep you engaged.  Nothing about this novel, from the characters to the sci-fi backdrop, was particularly believable, but it was so incredibly fun.  If you're looking for an action-packed sci-fi thriller, well, you've probably already read this one!\nFinally, I read Ship of Magic by Robin Hobb.  This is the next trilogy within the same fantasy universe as three other books I read late last year.  This one was a bit different, in that I don't really think it stood on its own as a singular novel — while the first three could have been read without touching any of the others, Ship of Magic really feels like one third of a book.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It was interesting, the world obviously as well-crafted as the same world from the first three; the way each character, even the patently evil ones, have something about them that makes them redeemable is astonishing and really makes you think.\nSo, of course, after a little bit of a back and forth, I decided to go straight into the next book in the series, The Mad Ship.  More to come when I finish it!\nWhew, I read a lot this month!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published two works:\n\nThe brilliant short story \"Talking To Strangers\" by Dan Morey,\nAnd the resonant poem \"A Way Forward\" by Stephanie Jean.\n\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 868,496 keys and clicked 157,095 times.\nI listened to 1,957 songs.\n13 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet\nI wrote 23,702 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

I haven't eaten at a restaurant or even gotten takeout in a full year.  I haven't seen the vast majority of my friends face-to-face, and those I have have been wearing masks.\nAlmost a whole year of staying inside, but I that also mans I'll be hitting a lot of one year milestones coming up soon, too.  This is the eleventh article in this series, for example!\nSo, of course, things have been quiet around here, but I'm having a good time.  I hope things are going well for you, too.\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nLife\nWell, things are going just fine here!  I have honestly been playing so many video games, which, you know, is fine — I have a Rocket League club with some friends, and we've been playing quite a lot.  I also go an incredibly good deal on Borderlands 3, which I've been slowly working my way through.  I honestly didn't expect to like it as much as I do!\nI've adjusted a lot of my routines.  One \"life hack\" I stumbled upon is that I now keep my phone in the other room at night, and have a physical alarm wake me up in the morning.  This forces me to actually get up at the time that I want to be getting up, which means I have more time in the morning… and though I'm technically getting less sleep than I used to, I feel great, because I just always feel better when I have a more consistent sleep schedule.\nI have done barely any textbook reading, which is a bit of a departure from the norm, but that's almost entirely because I've been reading so many articles, some of which cover subjects related to the small stack of textbooks I want to be working through.  Every morning, I'll get up, work through my RSS feeds a bit, then get up and get ready for my day, which is a routine I'm really proud of.\nProgramming\nThis month, I finally converted my silly scripts which I use to interface with git into something more public and manageable, and also wrote some new ones, too.  The biggest, most exciting one here is my git stick command, which allows me to just say git stick n and stick my changes on a commit n commits ago without having to invoke a tedious series of commands.  You can check out the repository here.\nI spent some of my personal code-writing time this month working on a bot framework for JQBX.  I ultimately ended up turning off the bot, since, well, lots of bots in one room can be sort of annoying, but it was a fun project while I had it running.  It was also cool to work on it as a logical extension of the bot framework I've been working on for Discord — many of the same commands the Discord bot has translated directly to JQBX, so all I had to do was plug it in and it just worked!\nI also wrote a quick script to generate the template for my music article, and I can't believe I'd been doing it by hand this entire time!  It's really nice to just put in the track ID and just be able to sit down and write.\nReading\nAs I mentioned last month, I was compelled by Robin Hobb's Liveship Traders Trilogy to just barrel right on through to the second book in the series, The Mad Ship which I finished earlier this month.  It was fun and great fantasy, but the thing that sticks out the most are the characters which make up the story.  There's an extremely large cast throughout this book, and all of their journeys are gripping, though some of them radically evolve, while others remain almost steadfast in their personalities.\nThis trilogy, though, might as well be categorized as one really long book — so, of course, I had to move right into Ship of Destiny, which I'm still working on.  After that, I'll almost certainly take a break from Hobb's work for a bit… but I'm sure it's only a matter of time before I get wrapped up by her next trilogy!\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 820,000 keys and clicked 132,499 times.\nI listened to 1,915 songs.\nOnly 4 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet —&nbsp;wow!\nI wrote 21,617 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

Things are pretty much all the same around here.  I hope things are going great for you too.\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nI've been listening to so much internet radio this month — I made a little roundup of some stations that play electronic music here.\nLife\nIt is extremely hard for me to quit things.  This month, I put a permanent pause on my Japanese learning.  I said goodbye to a 331 day Duolingo streak, and about a 240 day streak of Anki flashcards.  I do intend to continue my flashcard habit for all of the other things that I'm learning — like, for exampling, continuing to reinforce my terrible French that the university somehow gave me a degree in — but I just wasn't sufficiently motivated enough to continue to spend 20 minutes a day at the very least on this thing.  I do feel like a quitter.  But that's okay.  Sometimes the best move is to quit.  Since quitting, I've really felt like I've had a lot more free time… because, well, I have!  I'm not sure if this is a temporary pause or just giving up, but I think I'd like to take some time away from language learning for a little bit and then take a different approach sometime down the road.\nSpring is here!  I rearranged the back deck just a bit so that we could get as much privacy as possible — I can imagine all of our neighbors are going to be spending as much time outside as I will be, so I'm glad I took the preemptive measure to block off some sight lines so I can lounge about on our couch outside for hours just like I did last year… only, you know, with fewer moments of direct eye contact with the neighbors above and beside us. M and I also started some planting — well, almost entirely M, with a little bit of M pointing and me assisting.  We're already getting some sprouts, and we'll see how much they develop!\nI continue to play almost exclusively Rocket League as part of my video game time.  The club I'm in continues to use the Discord we set up specifically for this purpose, as an offshoot of another purpose-made Discord server, and we've been playing pretty regularly.  I'm still getting to the point where I'm not horrible at the normal game modes, but we have a whole lot of fun playing the extended game modes … and astonishingly enough, though I'm ranked pretty low on normal Soccar, I've been bouncing in and out of Diamond while playing Rumble with this group.\nI've also been playing a little bit of Genshin Impact, which is good fun!\nProgramming\nEarlier this month, work was deaccessioning some older servers, so I decided to grab one to give it a new permanent home.  Many people may warn you of this, but if you're thinking of running a server from your home, do not underestimate how large, loud, and heavy they are.  That being said, it was a lot of fun getting it set up — though I mostly leave it turned off, I now basically have a networked 18TB RAID6 drive.  A very loud one, but it's more storage than I'll ever need, and I learned a whole lot from the experience of setting it up… and it was free!\nI've automated more of my document management to get things done.  One thing I've been focusing on this month is my \"upkeep\" tasks — recurring tasks that don't necessarily have to happen on a specific day of the week or date of the month, but should generally happen around the same number of days apart.  These types of tasks fall into a pretty wide range:  there's stuff like chores — for example, I clean the bathroom every Sunday, but sometimes I do it on Monday or Saturday; or things like making sure I keep in touch with friends and family members.\nI moved notes.joewoods.dev to be a static site built with Zola.  It's pretty much using the same theme I built for this blog, with the old styling from the old notes site.  I basically only did this so that deployment would be easier, and so that I didn't have to write RSS templating by hand!\nI also built a quick script to generate text which describes articles I've saved to Pinboard with the tag \"roundup\" — articles that I think are share-worthy — and I've been publishing the list weekly here.  This idea was very much inspired by Tom Woodward's Weekly Web Harvest!\nReading\nNear the beginning of this month, I finished Ship of Destiny by Robin Hobb.  This was an interesting read, and the plot would have been immensely satisfying, if the novel hadn't used physical assault on a character as a cheap plot point in such a contrived way.  There were so many things about this book that I liked, but this specific element of it just sort of ruined the whole book for me.  But I've finally finished this trilogy, which means I get to move on — it took me 58 days to read these books, and though I mostly enjoyed it, I was certainly ready to move on by the end of it.\nNext, I finished Busy Doing Nothing by Rekka Bellum and Devine Lu Linvega.  This books is transcribed from the logbook which describes their 51-day journey by sailboat from Japan to Canada, and though many parts of it are rote descriptions of fact, between the lines are life-altering descriptions of human struggle and triumph, meditations on life and our places in it, and the small moments which define relationships.  I highly recommend this book, though I'll warn you that it may encourage you to make radical lifestyle changes, or otherwise be the catalyst for who you become years down the line.\nFinally, I've been working on Mistress of the Art of Death by Ariana Franklin, at the recommendation of my grandfather.  It's extremely good so far, but as always, more to come once I actually finish it!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published \"Panic Attack\" by Elizabeth Hazen and \"War's End\" by Andrew Joseph Kane.\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 950,000 keys and clicked 149,645 times.\nI listened to 1,924 songs. (This one is definitely skewed lower than normal by my not tracking some internet radio listening on last.fm.)\n15 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet.\nI wrote 23,430 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

And my next vaccine appointment is coming up very soon.  I am literally counting down the days.\nWe, as humans, mostly surround ourselves with like-minded people — this is why it's not surprising to me that all of my friends and colleagues seem to have the same mindset as me, which is a confusing mixture of \"okay, this was a tragic time, but it was also a radical shake-up of how things used to be; I see the light at the end of the tunnel and I'm ready to go back to the world, but let's make it better this time.\"\nFor some reason, Daylight Saving Time hit me really hard this year, but in the process of trying to fix my sleep schedule again after this massive disruption, some biological process inside of me just decided that I need one less hour of sleep each night.  It's not like I'm any more or less tired, I just sleep less now, which means I have an entire hour more each day to do some combination of relaxing and getting stuff done.  This might explain why this article is a bit longer than usual!  I'm not sure if this new sleep schedule is a permanent change or not, but I hope I can keep it going for as long as possible.\nI've subscribed to The New York Times, almost entirely so I could do the crossword, which I now spend a surprising amount of time on every day.  It turns out that I know a lot of people who also do the crossword, so it's nice to have yet one more thing to talk to them about… and M has started doing it too!\nThis also means that my RSS feeds have been absolutely flooded by the NY Times — I wrote a quick little thing about how I manage my RSS feeds from large publications.\nI passed a 365 day streak on 750words this month, which I celebrated by, of course, writing a blog post about it.\nThis month, M and I spent some time transferring some plants that we germinated indoors, as well as doing a bit of new planting outside, too.  The weather's getting quite nice, so I'm glad to be spending more time outdoors!\nAnother project M and I worked on together this month was to improve the lighting in our office.  Well, maybe \"improve\" is the wrong word.  Radically adjust, I should say.  My regular perusal of Slickdeals via their RSS feed pointed out a really great sale on nearly 20 meters of LED strip lights, so I decided to make the impulse purchase to buy them without actually knowing where we were going to install them.  We ended up lining two opposing walls in our office.  LED lights can make a space feel either too much like a college dorm, or too commercial, but I think we'll end up using them kind of selectively, instead of leaving them on all day.\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nProgramming\nI've been writing a great deal of code outside of work this month, which I'm very happy about!  I hope I can keep this momentum up.\nThere are, of course, a few secret and semi-secret projects in the work.  One Totally Top Secret project will hopefully wrap up in around a month or so, and I am absurdly excited about it.  I am only putting this here so I can say \"hey, remember that secret project I mentioned that I was very excited about?\" in a future article.\nOne semi-but-not-so-secret project I'm working on is to help develop a new bot framework for JQBX.  It's a very collaborative process; I've mostly written a bit of the plugin framework itself, but I've also found myself doing a lot of code review, which has been a fun change of pace.\nI've also completely refactored my Discord bot platform and made it available on Github!  My hope is that the API is intuitive and makes sense, so please feel free to use it, hack on it, and let me know what you think!\nI have also discovered the perfect code style for writing JavaScript, which I shared with the world this month as well.  (Note:  this is clearly horrible satire, please do not actually do this.)\nFinally, I continue to work on the automation of the things that keep my life on track.  I've built tools to process my recurring task tracking, as well as more automatic handling of TODOs.  I still feel like I haven't quite gotten this right, but as always, it's an iterative process.\nReading\nNear the middle of this month, I finished up Mistress of the Art of Death by Ariana Franklin.  I thought it was pretty good.  One recurring trope in the book is a constant nodding to the way that we do things now, as opposed to the thoughts and feelings of folks living during the rule of Henry II in what is now the Cambridge area.  For the most part, I found these interesting.  Maybe superhero films have spoiled me, but there were a few character choices that disappointed me here.  All in all, it was a really interesting and fast-paced book.\nNext, I re-read The Player of Games by Iain M. Banks.  There's just something about the Culture series that makes me immensely happy, and I'm sure I'll keep coming back to it for the rest of my life.\nFinally, I've started 1876 by Gore Vidal.  More to come when I finish it!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published \"The Rope Bridge\" by Susan Neville, and two poems by Melody Wilson, \"Language Acquisition\" and \"Rooster Cogburn.\"\nSome other stats\nThis month,\n\nI typed 990,000 keys and clicked 152,593 times.

I'm enjoying fully-vaccinated life — though I don't really go out that much still, it's so nice to just, like, go to the dog park and not worry.  I went to the Punk Rock Flea Market!  I took the bus for the first time in something like… 15 months!  I went back to IKEA!  I went back to the arcade!\nJust a little while longer now until the office reopens, and then I'll really feel like the world has shifted back into the place where I want it to be.\nOther than that, there's not a lot going on!  I've shifted to using Habitica again — I used it quite a bit back in 2014, when it was still known as HabitRPG.  Really, I think the delineation between habits, recurring tasks, and todos in Habitica is extremely powerful:  anything that I would try to build for myself would just be emulating that model, anyway, so I might as well use the real thing and maybe hack on it if there's something I'd like to see in it.  It has evolved so much since 2014, though, that I doubt there's anything about it that I'd want to touch!\nI suppose I also have to mention here that I've spent an absurd amount of time reading and learning about investing, a topic which I will only discuss with others if they bring it up first —&nbsp;so I hope that this ends up being the first and last time I mention this thing that's going to take up a not-insignificant amount of my time!\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nProgramming\nI think the theme this month for me has been learning AWS.  I've touched quite a few of the usual suspects:  Lambda, EC2, S3, and DynamoDB, Route 53 and Certificate Manager, EventBridge, Amplify, and CloudFront.  I want to spend more time with both Cognito and API Gateway — I only did a simple tutorial which kind of breezed through it so far — and I think there's a lot to be said about the time I've spent staring at the billing console so far, trying to make sense of it all.\nSo a lot of the code I wrote this month outside of work reflects that.\nFirst, I gave Quirk, my Discord chatbot framework, persistent memory using DynamoDB.  DynamoDB isn't really a great tool for this job, but with a little wiggling it, it really is an inexpensive database that can be plugged in and completely forgotten about.  I still feel like I'm getting the hang of DynamoDB, but this project was really straight-forward.\nI wrote this pretty cool (in my opinion, at least) visualization of the articles I've been sharing each week: https://dev.joewoods.dev/roundup/.  This is just another way of looking at the roundup articles, which I post every Sunday.  The implementation is a React app, which I build and then put the distributed files on a S3 bucket which has a CloudFront distribution pointing at it; for the actual data, I have a Lambda function pull down the raw data from the Pinboard API once per day (using EventBridge) and put it in a file in that same S3 bucket.  I think this way is a win-win:  I avoid expensive processing and instead cache the results, and Maciej doesn't ban me from a service that I use quite a bit.\nPart of my process for the failbetter redesign meant that I wanted to set up a local WordPress theme development workflow; I landed on DevKinsta, a very new tool which mostly acts as a wrapper for Docker, kind of on a lark.  A product of this is that I had to sort of reverse engineer the way their Docker containers work so that I could increase the upload size limit they had set — you can read more about this here.\nReading\nThough I mentioned 1876 in last month's article, I gave up on it pretty early in the month.  You'll see that a sort of pattern emerges throughout Vidal's historical fiction novels; the two I've read so far, Burr and Creation, are set against these magnificent, rich, exciting backdrops.  I just wasn't getting a lot out of the stagnant upper class in New York in 1876, so I decided to put the novel down instead.\nSo next I read Fugitive Telemetry by Martha Wells, the next Murderbot short story.  It's, of course, more Murderbot, which means that it's exciting and campy and fun and always feels way too short.  I had a very fun time reading it.\nNext, I made pretty good progress on Fortress Besieged by Qian Zhongshu.  I ended up putting it down after a while, though; I think I just wasn't in the right mindset to read anything but books about spaceships with guns attached to them.\nSo, naturally, next I read Providence by Max Barry.  This is like, peak Max Barry content.  I've been a fan of his for a long time — having discovered his work after playing NationStates long ago — and I've always really loved the perspective that each has.  Each of Barry's novels is immensely cinematic, and each pause from the action has a distinct purpose behind it — more often than not, for a giggle.  This kind of creates a tone that could be interpreted by some as immature, but I really don't care.  I'm always ready to get sucked in to an action novel and I have no pretense about it.  Also:  it's a bit of a wild coincidence that Max Barry released this book right at the beginning of the pandemic — it almost begs itself to be read as a COVID-19 allegory, which it clearly could not have been, given the timeline.\nAfter that, I figured, why not give my brain more sci-fi action?  So, on to Hail Mary by Andy Weir.  This is the third book by Weir that I've read, this one about a different celestial body.  This book is way more out-there than his other two, but still kind of the same; it was a lovely little romp with some clever hooks, just like you'd expect from Andy Weir.\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published:\n\n\"Responding to School Shootings: Six Proposals, and Some Anticipated Drawbacks\" by Ben Reed, and,\n\"Scorpio Rising\" by Dale Trumbore\n\nStats\n\nI typed 980,000 keys and clicked 160,420 times.\nI listened to 1,635 songs.\n16 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet.\nI wrote 24,051 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

I've spent so much of the last few months focusing on work, so when a major project wrapped up in the middle of this one… well, let's just say I haven't really adjusted yet!  I'm very much looking forward to returning to the office next month — though nothing's really going to be all that different, it kind of feels like life is about to radically change for me.\nM and I slowly emerged from our COVID-enduced sequester, finding new and fun ways to get outside and interact with the world a little bit.  I ate my first meal outside the apartment in a long, long time — we got vegan poutine and funnel cake from Fox &amp; Son in Reading Terminal Market almost completely on accident, since we'd ducked inside to avoid the rain.\nIn other exciting news, I got an iPhone!  I had a short adjustment period to iOS, and there are still a few quirks that I'm getting used to, but all in all I think the only way that Android beats out iOS is over the price point.  I'm now spending so much time on my phone — my Screen Time average last week was 6 hours and 37 minutes a day, though surely that's skewed by having videos on on my phone while I'm doing other things.  But still, I've been using this thing a lot.  There's just a few things about this device that really shine that I now can't imagine going without — the two biggest standouts are Face ID, which has sped up a ton of my workflows, mostly logging into services, and the shared clipboard between my MacBook and my phone.  However, the biggest win is just that navigating my RSS feeds is so much easier on this device — web content loads so much more quickly, and the Reeder app is much better than any purpose-built RSS reader apps I'd found on iOS.\nI took a trip up to Rhode Island to visit some family over a long weekend.  It was my first time leaving Philly in 16 months, which was honestly a little overwhelming.  I have always really loved taking the train, so it was really nice for my first trip fully-vaccinated to be on the Amtrak.  I took a few great pictures, got to see some family I haven't seen in a long time, and, of course, got a Del's.\nOther than that, not a whole lot is going on!  I continued my Finance as a Hobby (FaaH?) research and watched a whole lot of the Euro 202~0~ tournament.\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nGames\nSo, like I mentioned, I've been spending a lot of time on my phone, so these are just iOS games!\nFirst, I played through What the Golf, which was delightful and surprising.  I was really glad that the game somehow managed to stay entirely fresh, introducing new gags at just the right time, and extending gameplay in a smart way that's totally optional.  I enjoyed getting crowns for the levels that I really found joy in, but otherwise just continuing on my way.\nI feel like Good Sudoku has completely rewritten my brain.  I've been a huge fan of Zach Gage's games, and I was excited to be able to run the full Apple Arcade gamut.  Good Sudoku is exactly that — the way the tools of the game set you up to be able to do creative problem solving in a low-stakes way is almost exactly the type of leisure my brain wants to be doing.  I've been playing it so much that I've even been getting the Tetris Effect for sudoku puzzles, which is an interesting experience!\nI've tried a few other iOS games, but nothing has quite stuck so far like those two have.\nProgramming\nLike I mentioned, not a whole lot of code writing happened outside of work for me!\nOne small thing is that my homepage now has an RSS feed that collates two of my writing locations — this blog and my more general notes page — so that folks can follow both a bit more easily.  I have vague plans to improve, expand, and maybe even make this available to more people, but I actually learned that these vague plans were just getting in my way of me just doing the thing, so I did the thing!\nReading\nThis month, I read The Windfall by Diksha Basu.  I have a lot of mixed feelings about this one — it certainly had some interesting moments, but the underlying premise of \"help, I don't know how to be rich!\" that so many characters in this book portrayed doesn't really appeal to me, personally.\nI also read The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing by Larimore, Lindauer, and LeBoeuf.  All information about finance is dry as all heck, but these folks did a good job of presenting the necessary information in a relatable and entertaining way.  I think, really, what I was aiming to get out of this book was a little bit of confidence and the feeling like I'm on the right track —&nbsp;and I think I succeeded!\nNext, I decided I wanted to reread The Crow Road by Iain Banks.  I haven't made that much progress into it so far, but it's just as good as I remember.\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published:\n\n\"Visitation\" by Matthew Pitt, and,\n\"I Received a Bitter Email from a Good-Hearted Man\" by John Wall Barger\n\nStats\n\nI typed 850,000 keys and clicked 145,285 times.\nI listened to 1,757 songs.\n15 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet.\nI wrote 22,821 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

I know this is contrary to the current narrative in the programming industry, but I actually strongly prefer working from the office.  I like going out and seeing people face-to-face; I like taking the subway, and I like having the opportunity to go walk around the city while I'm down there.  Though, to be honest, I haven't been doing a lot of that, since it's so dang hot outside.\nBut the real biggest perk to working from the office is that I can come home and not be just utterly exhausted.  Working from home, it was impossible for me to write code for honestly way more hours than I should have been and then turn and think about any projects that I want to work on for my own sake.  And really, it was kind of a struggle to even do the things that I had to do just to keep the gears turning in my life.  Working from the office, though, I come home and for the most part I've been filled with energy and ready to take on, well, just about anything.\nIt's been a balancing act, but I really prefer this balancing act to the one before, so I'm very grateful to be back.  Let's hope that my fears are unfounded and we won't have to go back to working from home again.\nRik Signes and I worked together to create a Fastmail-specific interface for a Vestaboard splitflap board installation, which you see when you first walk into the office.  We have a slack bot that we interface with for a lot of things around the company, so Rik wrote the ability to manage what gets posted to the board (so that someone couldn't hog the board or immediately overwrite something that someone else has put up, for example).  I wrote a frontend for people to be able to edit and preview their messages before they're posted.  I think it turned out pretty great!\n\n    \n    \n        The Vestaboard in action\n    \n\nIn other news, earlier in the month, I took another trip up to Rhode Island, making it two trips in the span of about a month.  This time, M came up with me; we drove up and back and stayed in a hotel in Providence.  This was for a more sad occasion, but we still managed to really enjoy ourselves and make the trip feel like a real trip and not an obligation.\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nGames\nI'm still on my Good Sudoku kick, developing new strategies to attempt to rank higher each day in the daily good and arcade modes.  I've also picked up Desert Golfing again, which is a great way to pass a minute or two, here and there.  At the tail end of the month, I started playing SongPop Party, the immensely addictive music trivia game:  a song plays, and you guess which song it is (or, sometimes, the artist) as quickly as possible.  There are playlists within genres; the online \"arena\" mode is fun, because you have a one-in-four chance of your playlist being selected, and while I do feel like I have a bit of an advantage in any of the \"rock\" playlists, there are some that are a bit out there — like, for example, when I somehow managed to win a match where someone selected only Avril Lavigne songs.\nProgramming\nI wrote an application framework for AWS!  The first iteration of this is a sort of \"microblog\" which lives here: https://dev.joewoods.dev/posts/\nI still need to figure out more ways to get those little posts I've been making out there more so that I'm not just entirely talking to myself, but I'm sure that will come later.  I did give it an RSS feed, though, because you gotta have an RSS feed.\nThis project has not only been a really great learning experience, but I'm also really glad to have this sort of base application that I can use to really quickly iterate on ideas.  I plan to just let it run without tinkering too much for a very short break — hopefully only as long as it takes me to wrap up a small project for failbetter — and then shore things up and add a few more features.\nAWS is … interesting. I've really bought into the philosophy of abstracting away the hardware, but there's a huge gap between the entry-point application and a production-ready application using AWS.  The documentation is, unfortunately, lacking in a lot of ways, and each service's web interface has its quirks, some of which are actually quite difficult to work around.\nBuilding something with AWS ultimately feels like building a kit car, bridging together radically different components with semi-theoretical knowledge of how they work under the hood.  I tried to count all of the AWS services that this admittedly small project touches, and kind of gave up; I think, right now, I'm sitting at something like 8.5.\nAnd even for all of the AWS complications happening in the backend, the frontend is absurdly simple — raw, no-framework javascript, using Vite as the test and build system.  It rules.\nYou should definitely expect to hear more about this framework soon!\nOther than that project, I think the only other code of note I wrote outside work was this little toy project to grab a random message from a Discord channel.\nReading\nI wrapped up The Crow Road by Iain Banks late this month.  Like I mentioned last month, this is a re-read for me — I don't think it really gripped me as much as it did the first time around, which is kind of a shame.  Even if I'm realizing that this is no longer my favorite novel ever written, there's a long list of novels he's written — mostly under the name Iain M. Banks — which would then fall into contention for the number one place in my esteem.  I don't really know what it was the first time around — maybe this is another one of those cases where I expected perfection, and instead got something very good, but because my expectations weren't met, I ended up disappointed?  Who knows!\nClosing out the month, I made a small amount of progress into Lurkers by Sandi Tan — more to come on that front next month!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published:\n\n\"Nudes\" by Hillary Suzanne\n\"SO NOW THAT YOU’VE BEEN DIAGNOSED!\" by Joseph Di Prisco\n\"driver and pedestrian at the intersection\" by Robert Fleming\n\nStats\n\nI typed 760,000 keys and clicked 132,090 times.\nI listened to 1,068 songs.\n5 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet.\nI wrote 23,720 words in my personal journal.\n\nThat's it!

Here's what I've been up to.\nLife\nAfter several starts and stops, I've finally developed an actual workout routine.  Fitbod has been a huge help — I'm really not a fan of their price point, but you can't really argue with results!\nI am, as always, working on the way that I plan out and reflect on my day.  I've somehow ended up with three journal-like things:  first, my online journal which I write every morning using 750 words hasn't changed.  I've taken up my daily agenda system again, to mixed results, but I'm no longer doing the repetitive tracking in it that made it onerous — instead of managing my daily habits on pen and paper, I'm still doing that in Habitica, but I've more gone back to using a notebook to plan out and keep track of my schedule for the day.  Finally, inspired by my rereading of The Crow Road, I'm keeping an incredibly short log of what I've done each day in another notebook.  I really like this habit, and I hope I keep it for a while; I think I basically need to be in it for the long haul, since it'll only really pay off when I want to go back and reflect on days in the past.\nFinally, I've started playing chess again!  I'm playing on lichess, and I'm doing a little bit of studying with Magnus Trainer.\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nProgramming\nWork continues on the microblog platform; I've made some improvements to, well, just about every piece of it now.  I can tell I'm kind of slowing down the pace as I near the \"final touches,\" but I think if I can just push through one more plateau, I'll now have this great cloud-based platform to start building other services on.  Also, the URL has moved!  You can find those silly posts I'm making here: https://posts.woodssites.com/\nI also wrapped up a very quick tool to see which media features your browser reports, which you can find here: https://dev.joewoods.dev/media-features.  I think it still needs some work, but this is the minimum-viable version, and at least it's out there now!\nI've just scratched the surface of Programming in Prolog by Clocksin and Mellish.  I haven't quite reached the magic bits yet, but hopefully I'll forge ahead and have more updates when I get there.\nReading\nWithin the first few days of the month, I had already given up on Sandi Tan's Lurkers.  I don't want to give too much of the book away, but it got to the point where I realized that it definitely wasn't for me — the level of psychological violence depicted in the book just wasn't something I was comfortable with.\nNext, I read Dark Matter by Blake Crouch.  I really wasn't a fan.  I really liked his later novel, Recursion, but I'm glad I ended up reading them out of order, because Dark Matter has actually somehow impacted my opinion of Recursion.  I didn't think the characters in Dark Matter were believable; the thin wrapper of science fiction was kind of absurd and clearly based on a misunderstanding of the actual concept in physics that Crouch attempted to wrap magic around; the horror sections of the book were at best eye-rollingly frustrating … I could go on and on.  I typically don't expound so much on books I don't like, but I was incredibly disappointed by this one.\nSo, ending a run of four books that I ended up being disappointed by — my unconditionally positive review was in May! — I read Fool's Errand by Robin Hobb.  I did end up enjoying this one — I think I liked it the least out of the six previous books in the series, but it was still an exciting adventure, even if it wasn't as fun of a romp as the other novels.  There were a few tricks the Hobb had to employ to shake the rust off of a few characters, since they were essentially left aside for a three-book intermission, and I think this made the novel not really come together for me as much as I would have liked.  Nevertheless, this is the first novel in a long time that I found myself setting as much time aside as possible to read.  And now, of course, I have to pace myself, otherwise I'd want to just immediately pick up the next book in the series!\nAfter that, I read The 22 Murders of Madison May by Max Barry.  Barry has always been one of my favorite authors, and I read his novel Providence back in May of this year.  In my view, Barry skirts this line between pulp and too-clever extremely well, making novels that always feel like action films, incredibly well paced with the absolutely cheesiest one-liners thrown in that you can't help but to chuckle at.  But, of course, eventually one of these novels was going to be a bit of a miss for me.  I enjoyed it, but not as much as I typically enjoy Barry's work — this one felt way more like a horror film, and I tend to avoid those.  Also, it's completely unfortunate that this novel was released at a time where we're really facing a flood of the sci-fi motif that this story is built around, and though Barry has done it the best that I've seen so far, I'm just not a huge fan of the trope in general.  I definitely had a good time, but I would recommend that folks new to Barry's work start with another one of his novels instead.\nHuh, looks like I read a lot this month!\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published \"The Fall\" by Joy Guo and \"Orphan\" by Christina Reiss.\nStats\n\nI typed 790,000 keys and clicked 118,424 times.\nI listened to 859 songs.\n1 album escaped from the Album Gauntlet.

The cat is out of the bag, and our partnership with 1Password is now live, and I'm extremely excited by it.  But this was taking up a lot of processing time, so to speak, so I don't have much else to show for this month other than that.\nI've continued my workout habit with Fitbod, and I'm really happy with the results so far.  If we weren't in the middle of a global pandemic, I might consider actually joining a gym soon, but I think that's off the table for the time being, considering the state of things.\nMusic\nHere's this month's installment of the playlist!  I hope you enjoy it.  Here's the article, and here's the playlist on Spotify:\n\nProgramming\nI've thrown a few things on GitHub this month:\nnwork, a simple tool to enable development of your modules.  There's clearly a lot more to do in order to get this past \"proof of concept\" stage, but I think it's going to be useful for some of the things I'm working on.\nSeries, an API for creating Generator instances in JavaScript.  I've recently taken a complete 180 on generators — I used to avoid them, but now I love them.  They're blisteringly fast, and once you get a handle on them, they solve so many problems in an elegant way.  There is, however, a lot of boilerplate involved in order to instantiate one, so Series provides an interface to make this a lot easier.  Because this is also a bit of a proof of concept, the best demonstration of what this actually does is probably a quick read of the test cases.\nvesta-image, a server which can be used to generate composite images representing the state of Fastmail's Vestaboard split-flap board.  Essentially, you load a url which includes the state of the board, and the server combines images for each applicable flap in the spliftlap to make one single composite image that looks pretty close to what you would actually see on the board in real life.  This was more of a problem to solve with Photoshop than anything else, but the results are pretty dang close, and I'm pretty proud of how this one came together!\nReading\nThis month, I read The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue.  I honestly wasn't a fan.  I couldn't really identify with any of the characters; I didn't really understand their decisions or motivations.  It felt like a perpetual bait-and-switch:  when things were set up to be in interesting environments, or when the action of the novel seemed to be building up to something big, there was just a let-down at the end of it.  And speaking of the end of it:  yeesh.  I don't want to give anything away, but there are many aspects of this book that are just plain unhealthy and bad.\nI decided to dip back into the most comforting thing I know again in the Culture, proceeding with my re-read by getting through Use of Weapons.  This is definitely not my favorite Culture novel, and re-reading it, it has a lot of problems, but it's still a Culture novel, and therefore it still makes me feel good.\nfailbetter\nThis month, failbetter published \"Stay Home, Stay Safe\" by Laura Hulthen Thomas and \"Photographic Memory #9 (Nocturne)\" by Hun Ohm.\nStats\n\nI typed 750,000 keys and clicked 113,302 times.\nI listened to 861 songs.\n0 albums escaped from the Album Gauntlet.

I have no idea why — probably because the world's so topsy-turvy right now that I've made it a point to make so many routines as possible.  Maybe because I've watched フリクリ (FLCL) so many times that it's become baked into who I am, the very foundation for who I view myself as.\nI also really, really love Dance Dance Revolution.\nThe other thing that makes this whole \"I'm nearly thirty and deciding to learn another language\" thing more complicated is that I am already bilingual.  Well, sort of.  I received a minor in French as part of my university studies.  I know a lot of French, so I'm able to understand it in the written and spoken form.  I was just incredibly lazy while learning it, so my ability to use it has suffered.  Nevertheless, while learning French, I also took the time to (mostly) learn the writing systems of Japanese, katakana and hiragana.  I've since strengthened that skill so that it's more automatic and natural.  My plan is, this time around, to be more precise and intentional in my approach, though I no longer have the formal structure of the classroom to guide me.\nA lot of people have good reasons to learn languages.  I do not.  I think my brain is just wired to want to learn languages, [1] so I've built a lot of routines around giving myself space to be able to do so.  There have been quite a few times where I've asked myself, \"why am I doing this?\"  I have no good answer.  There's no one goal that I really have.  I'd like to spend more time in Japan than just passing through Narita International, but it's not like that's on my bucket list. [2]\nSo:  why am I learning Japanese?  I don't have a good answer.\n\nWhy choose this as our goal? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?\n\nHow I study\nI study a number of flashcard decks as part of my morning routine, typically while eating breakfast.  Today, for example, I studied 184 flashcards in a little under 25 minutes.  Anki reports that 57 of those cards and 15 of those minutes were for my KanjiDamage deck.\nAnki is the flashcard system you must use.  I use it to memorize just about everything, but for Japanese, I'm currently working through the stock KanjiDamage deck.  KanjiDamage is a free online dictionary which is extremely inappropriate in its contents sometimes, but contains a number of helpful mnemonics as well as a novel ordering system in order to build on the knowledge that you're making.\nI typically learn two or three new kanji per day, and spend most of my revision time just reinforcing what I already know.  This is, admittedly, slow progress, but it I feel like I've struck a balance in the amount of time I spend on this every day.\nIn the evenings, I'll do a little bit of Duolingo in Japanese as well.  I typically do this at the same time as the rest of my evening routine, which is a smattering of chores mixed in with a quick workout.  I'll probably spend ten or fifteen minutes on Duolingo each night, give or take, so my progress here has been relatively slow going as well.\nAnd, of course, there's other media that I engage with.  I hope, soon, that I'll be able to start doing full-immersion-type activities.  It's one thing to watch a film or a show with subtitles, but I really felt like I started understanding French when I started playing video games in it.  It's not so easy to do things like change your phone and laptop's language to Japanese, though… because if you don't know a kanji, it's going to take quite a bit of effort to riddle it out!\nIs this useful?\nYou may say the best way to learn Japanese is to read a textbook cover-to-cover.  Fooey on that.  My routines are great for me because they are routines.  I would be shocked if I ever give them up.  Even on my worst days, I'm still engaging with the process and meeting the bare minimum that I've set for myself — the minimum being a triumph in itself!\nAm I learning bad habits?  Oh, absolutely.  But I still maintain, when learning anything, shortcuts are often good.  They set up a foundation which you can adjust over time, while still being able to build on the foundation better and more quickly.  The most important thing for me, right now, is building my framework so that it carries me into the future.\nSo:  I don't want to hear anything about Duolingo being bad!\nHow far I've come\nThough I have numbers to quantify how much I've learned so far, it's actually sort of difficult to qualify those numbers..  I'm now over 100 kanji in in KanjiDamage; Duolingo claims that I've \"learned\" 838 words, but that is almost certainly a garbage number.  Looking at a random list of JLPT N5 kanji online, I can look at each one and say \"oh, that represents this concept.\"  I probably have the on'yomi and kun'yomi memorized for 3/5ths of them, and probably really need to work on my readings for a fifth of them.\nBut, of course, my mechanics are probably horrendous right now.  This is because of two things:  I've mostly been focusing on vocabulary, and Duolingo's more informal approach to teaching the rules of a language mean that I can't point to concrete rules.  …Yet!  But hopefully I'm sublimating a lot of concepts that I'll be able to put names to … relatively soon.\nNext steps\nTo some extent, my goal has always been to pass the JLPT N5.  And I think I'm on track, if I wanted to consider taking it at the next possible opportunity, which would be half a year from now!  But with work and life, I think it would be more realistic to try to aim for a year from now and to set up a study plan to get there.\nSo I suppose it's just going to be business as usual for a while.  I don't want to disrupt any of my routines, but the next step will be that I need to start reading and learning from an actual Japanese textbook, like Genki.\nNotes\n\nThis is so much different from people who claim that their brains are not wired to learn languages (as opposed to to want to).  I firmly believe that nobody has the innate ability to learn languages besides babies.  Language acquisition requires an immense amount of training, passion, discipline, and humility.  One must elect to strive for those things.  I've heard so many people say they're just \"not good at learning languages.\"  No.  Nobody is good at learning languages.\nOwning a full, arcade-size Dance Dance Revolution cabinet is.\n\n","id":"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/japanese-150-days/","title":"Getting Serious about Learning Japanese: 150 Days In"}},"docInfo":{"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/":{"body":9,"title":1},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202001-best/":{"body":478,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/20200203-best/":{"body":1375,"title":5},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202004-best/":{"body":866,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202005-best/":{"body":562,"title":3},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202006-best/":{"body":597,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202007-best/":{"body":826,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202008-best/":{"body":875,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202009-best/":{"body":1222,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202010-best/":{"body":953,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202011-best/":{"body":735,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202012-best/":{"body":750,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202101-best/":{"body":737,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202102-best/":{"body":589,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202103-best/":{"body":473,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202104-best/":{"body":715,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202105-best/":{"body":723,"title":3},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202106-best/":{"body":460,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202107-best/":{"body":768,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202108-best/":{"body":760,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/202109-best/":{"body":527,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/music/the-gauntlet/":{"body":617,"title":6},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/other-thoughts/":{"body":3,"title":1},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/other-thoughts/how-to-take-notes-on-a-text/":{"body":618,"title":3},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/other-thoughts/overheard-on-the-subway/":{"body":43,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/other-thoughts/writing-750-words-a-day/":{"body":303,"title":4},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/alfred-emoji-modified/":{"body":328,"title":6},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/analytics/":{"body":227,"title":5},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/display-p3/":{"body":324,"title":6},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/meta-content-with-zola/":{"body":316,"title":3},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/technology/new-blog/":{"body":467,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/":{"body":9,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202004/":{"body":575,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202005/":{"body":429,"title":1},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202006/":{"body":380,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202007/":{"body":557,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202008/":{"body":672,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202009/":{"body":861,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202010/":{"body":633,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202011/":{"body":403,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202012/":{"body":673,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202101/":{"body":496,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202102/":{"body":409,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202103/":{"body":603,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202104/":{"body":560,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202105/":{"body":609,"title":1},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202106/":{"body":536,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202107/":{"body":632,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202108/":{"body":571,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/202109/":{"body":331,"title":2},"https://blog.joewoods.dev/updates/japanese-150-days/":{"body":625,"title":6}},"length":52}};
